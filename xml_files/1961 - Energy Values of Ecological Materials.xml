 ENERGY VALUES OF ECOLOGICAL MATERIALS
 FRANK B. GOLLEY
 AEC, Savannah River Project, University of Georgia
 Since Lindeman (1942) formulated his concept of trophic dynamics, American ecologists have become in- creasingly interested in the energy relationships of eco- systems. Even though<Node id="1777"/> the application of thermodynamic theory to ecology has progressed rapidly (see Odum 1956, Odum and Pinkerton 1955, Patten 1959, Sobodkin 1960),<Node id="1921"/> understanding of the energy dynamics of individ- ual populations has been hampered by incomplete knowl- edge of the energy content of many plants and animals. In energy flow studies it is often necessary to convert biomass to energy by using caloric equivalents obtained from the literature. However, many workers, reluctant to depend upon equivalents, have made their own energy determinations in the oxygen bomb calorimeter. <Node id="2349"/>This paper summarizes my analyses of over 400 wild plants and animals collected from the field and over 200 anal- yses of other workers.<Node id="2485"/> These values were previously listed in a mimeographed publication (Golley 1959).
<Node id="2567"/> I am indebte(d to a number of persons who have aided these studies. <Node id="2636"/>In 1956-57 equipment for caloric analyses in the laboratories of the Department of Foods and Nu- trition, Michigan State University, was used through the courtesy of Dr. Evelyn Jones. Later studies were made in the ecological laboratory of Dr. E. P. Odum, Univ. of Ga. and the work was supported by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, contract At(07-2)-10. I am grateful to Dr. Odum for his critical comments (luring these investigations. I am also grateful to Drs. lawrence Bliss, Univ. of Illinois; Francesco Trama, Rutgers Univ.; Edward Kuenzler, Woods Hole Ocean- ographic Institute; Clyde Connell, Valdosta State Col- lege, Ga.; and J. D). Ovington, The Nature Conservancy, London for providing unpublished data from their studies.
 M ETHI-ODS
 <Node id="3386"/>The caloric value of ecological materials was deter- mined by burning samples in a Parr oxygen bomb calo- rimeter. <Node id="3501"/>The standard procedure for determining energy values is fully discussed in the Parr Manual (1948).
 Since the purpose of the measurements is to provide estimates of energy content of biomass that can be applied to populations of plants and animals in the field, the samples must reflect the variations inherent in field populations. <Node id="3834"/>Therefore, vegetation samples are col- lected from random I)lots on study areas, dried at 100C for 24 hours and ground in a Wiley Mill fitted with a 40 mesh-to-the-inch screen.<Node id="4010"/> When only the small mill is available, portions from pooled samples from all plots are selected for grinding. The ground tissue is then thoroughly mixed in jars before samples are re- moved for calorimetry.
 Since the amount of body fat (which has a high energy value) varies with age and season in many animals, each age group must be sampled at each season to obtain a caloric estimate that can be applied to the populations at specific seasons. For many groups of animals, e.g., insects collected by sweep-netting, the en- tire dried sample can be run through the mill. For fleshy animals, such as birds or mammals, specimens are minced in a Waring Blender, the slurry of water and tissue dried in a vacuum oven, and the dried material grotin(1 in the Wiley Mill. Extremely fat animals are
 difficult to handle even with this procedure. With these it is best to extract the fat after vacuum drying then redry and combust the nonfat residue.
 <Node id="4956"/>The calorimeter is restandardized (the water equiv- alent determined) every third month, especially when the laboratory temperatures fluctuate widely. <Node id="5107"/>The magnesium fuse wire and the total acid corrections are
 determined for each individual analysis, rather than as- sumed to be constant, <Node id="5246"/>since the amounts of fuse wire used and the acid produced vary widely. For instance, insect samples may require more than 9.0 ml of base to neutralize the acid formed during combustion, while
 plant material usually requires only 5.0 ml or less. The difference of 4 ml is equivalent to 4 g cal. The amount of fuse wire burned has varied from 9.3-3.6 cm in these studies. Corrections are made by measuring the unburned wire with a ruler (1 cm of burned wire =2.8 g cal) and by titrating the bomb washings with a sodium carbonate solution (3.658 g Na2CO3/1H2O, 1 ml solution -_1 g cal).<Node id="5830"/>
 The per cent ash in each sample has been determined since 1958. This merely requires drying and weighing the tarred calorimeter cup containing the ash after the tests are completed. The caloric value per gram ash- free weight more accurately reflects differences between materials than the value per gram dry weight because of contamination. Samples of roots and ground litter, in particular, often contain soil which cannot be dis- lodged by routine washing and if it is included the caloric value will be lowered.
<Node id="6348"/> The Parr Manual (1948) states that the American Society for Testing Materials requires 0.3% accuracy for tests of the same material made in the same labora- tory and 0.5% for tests made in different laboratories. I have not achieved this degree of accuracy with all types of ecological materials and have accepted as satis- factory a variation of not more than 3.0% between 3 tests on a given sample.<Node id="6749"/> All of my analyses have been run in triplicate.
 <Node id="6799"/>The caloric value of plant materials was tabulated under 3 categories: plant parts, month collected, and ecological community. <Node id="6926"/>Comparisons between members of a category were tested by an analysis of variance procedure. Mr. James Fortson, Institute of Exper- inmental Statistics, Univ. of Ga., transformed the data using matrices and the statistics were calculated on an IBM 650 computer. Significance of the difference be- tween values in each separate category was determined with the F-test. Animal caloric values were subjected to an analysis of variance using a desk calculator. Since many values were obtained from the literature or were made before the ash-correction became routine, all are reported as gram calories per gram dry weight.<Node id="7543"/>
 RESULTS
<Node id="7553"/> Table I presents the mean energy values for parts of plants.<Node id="7614"/> The differences are significant at the 99% level (F = 27.72, d.f. = 4 and 462). Seeds, which often con- tain high proportions of fat, have the highest values. Long (1934), one of the first to apply calorimetric meth- ods in ecological research, also found that energy values varied for parts of the plant. In the sunflower

 The seasonal analysis <Node id="8721"/>includes vegetative samples from
 3 old-field communities: a blue-grass field in Mich., a broomsedge field and young pine stand in Ga. (Table II)<Node id="8866"/>. 
<Node id="8869"/>Values for the dominant plants in these 3 com- munities were grouped so that the comparison is between months, irrespective of the species of plants. The anal- ysis of variance showed that significant differences at
 the 99% level (F = 2.36, d.f. = 11 and 272) existed between months. The highest caloric values occurred in the fall and winter, presumably from storage of energy in the roots, culms, and seeds. Morrison (1949) re-
 ports that in many plants the per cent of crude protein in the green foliage decreases, that of crude fiber and nitrogen-free extract (mostly carbohydrate) increases,
 while that of ether extract (partly fat) remains con-
 stant through the growing season<Node id="9556"/>. Accordingly, the caloric value of the foliage should be higher in the spring than in the fall. However, when considering all parts of the vegetation growing in the community the caloric value per gram total vegetation (including roots and
 seeds) appears to be greater in the fall and winter. <Node id="9851"/>Caloric data are available for the dominant plants in 9
 ecological communities, ranging from tropical rain-forest to alpine tundra.<Node id="9983"/> The pine community data furnished by J. 1). Ovington are from England. The alpine tundra data obtained by L. Bliss are from New Hampshire. The Spartina (analysed by C. Connell), the Andropogon, and the old-field herb communities were studied in Ga., the Poa community in Mich., and the rain-forest and mangrove forest in Puerto Rico. The values in Table

The statistical analysis showed that the average caloric value per gram total vegetation (roots, leaves, and stems) in these communities differed significantly at the 99% level (F = 11.3, d.f. = 8 and 343). The tundra estimates were considerably higher than those for the other com- munities indicating that communities with a long period of nonproduction accumulate a greater energy store than those which grow throughout the year. However, the pine community, with its high resin and turpentine con- tent, also had a high energy value.<Node id="11671"/>

However, the same comparison but using calories per gram ash-free weight (Table IV) shows significant differences at the 95% level between seasons only.

 ENERGY VALUES OF ANIMALS
 Only limited caloric data are available for animals. Seven taxa, including invertebrates and vertebrates, are in Table V. The crabs were especially low in energy content, probably because the calcareous exoskeleton was not separated from the soft parts. E. P. Odum has provided unpublished data on the ash content of crabs from Sapelo Island, Ga., which indicate that the ash is about 51% of the total dry weight. This means that the caloric value per gram ash-free weight for crabs is about 4400 cal.

<Node id="15152"/> The analysis of variance showed that the energy value of the animals, excluding the crabs, did not differ significantly (F- 1.84, d.f. = 5 and 63). In general, the values for the animals are about 1000 g cal/g dry wt higher than the plant values.<Node id="15399"/>
 <Node id="15401"/>DISCUSSION<Node id="15411"/>
 <Node id="15413"/>Examination of over 600 records of plants has shown that significant differences in caloric value exist between plant parts, between vegetation collected in different months, and between vegetation growing in different ecological communities. <Node id="15656"/>When the variation in chemical composition of various cultivated and noncultivated crop plants reported in Morrison (1949) is considered (e.g., fat ranges from 1.0% in Lespedeza stems to 38.8% in wild mustard seed) and the fact that Long (1934) found that caloric values varied with light intensity, length of day, amount of nutrients, and type of soil, the observed differences are not unexpected.
<Node id="16055"/> Richman and Slobodkin (1960) have emphasized the constancy of the caloric value of animal tissue. Except under starvation or storage conditions animal tissue averages about 5000 g cal/g dry wt. The data in this report are less extensive but support their conclusions. Richman and Slohodkin (1960) point out that when an animal is storing food material before hibernation or a nonfeeding portion of the life cycle, the energy value of the body may increase to 6000 or 7000 g cal/g dry xvt.<Node id="16544"/> This condition in animals is analogous to the seed stage in the life history of the plant and to the fall condition of many perennial plants which store food in the root, tuber, or rhizomes. <Node id="16736"/>This analogy helps to explain why significant( differences exist between the plant categories.<Node id="16830"/>
 <Node id="16832"/>The caloric value of a plant or animal is a function of its genetic constitution, nutritive condition, and life his-
 tory. Because these factors may vary with species, seasons, and environmental conditions the ecologist making intensive measurements of energy flow through natural systems cannot depend on caloric constants or equivalents. This study shows that the ecologist must determine the energy content under the specific condi- tions of his particular study. However, those engaged in extensive surveys are probably justified in convert- ing biomass to energy by using the average caloric values in the tables.<Node id="17451"/>
 SUMMARY
 <Node id="17462"/>This report summarizes and evaluates the variation between caloric values of plants and animals. <Node id="17559"/>Analysis of over 600 records shows significant differences between plant parts, between vegetation collected in different seasons, and between vegetation from different ecological communities.<Node id="17751"/> Differences between animal taxa were not significant. <Node id="17806"/>It was concluded that ecologists should directly determine the energy content of ecological mate- rials when studying energy flow through natural sys- tems. It is also hoped, however, that the average val- ues presented may be useful for energy estimation in some types of ecological research.

 INFLUENCE OF THINNING OF RED PINE PLANTATION ON SOIL1
 F. P. HABERLAND AND S. A. WILDE
 Recent research in Germany and Russia revealed that thinnings increase the diameter of trees and hence the value of forest stands, but not the total production of dry matter. These observations are valid under many site conditions but cannot be generalized indiscriminately and interpreted to mean that the yield of the thinned stand remains the same regardless of the form of partial cutting.
 A partial cutting is a major operation which returns the stagnating community of trees to a productive life by removing the unwanted members of the stand. How- ever, if it is not performed with respect to the habitat conditions, it may result in a lasting deterioration of the site quality; it may bring about invasion of competing vegetation, depletion of soil water, increased or retarded decomposition of organic remains, loss of nutrients through leaching or biological fixation, compaction of the soil surface, rise of the water table, or accumulation of vadose water.
 To counteract such adverse alterations, attempts have been made recently to detect by field and laboratory ana- lyses the effect of cuttings on the growth factors of the treated stand, particularly on the dynamics of water and nutrients in different types of soils (Zonn 1959, Sviridov 1959). Such investigation constitutes a long overdue effort to place on a firm scientific foundation the present, totally empirical practice of silvicultural cuttings. The ultimate aim of the analytical approach is to identify the intensity of partial cuttings with the optimum sub- canopy environment and thereby increase the volume and the value of the treated stand. The more restricted, immediate goal is the elimination of mistreatment of stands which diminishes the productive potential of the soil-forest entity and disrupts its biological cycle (Remezov et al. 1959).
 This paper reports the results of an investigation of the changes in physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soil induced by heavy thinning of a dense pine plantation. Considerable time has been spent in devising analytical techniques suitable for this type of research. This report summarizes the most significant alterations observed during the last 3 growing seasons.
 METHODS OF STUDY
 The study was conducted in a 15-yr-old plantation of red pine, Pimis resinosa Ait., in central Wisconsin on a
 non-podzolic outwash sand of Plainfield series. The level topography, stone-free porous soil, and uniform tree growth of this 40 acre plantation were favorable for detailed investigation of the effect of thinnings on soil properties.
 In the spring of 1958, 1/3 acre plots were established in a fully stocked part of the plantation, having basal area of 156 sq. ft., in a part thinned to 50% of basal area, and on adjacent cleared land (Fig. 1).
 FIG. 1. General view of a part of the study area showing the clear cut plot and fully stocked plantation.
 Percolation of water and movement of soluble nutrient salts were studied by alundum tension lysimeters (Cole 1958, Krause 1960). Two lysimeters were installed in each plot at a depth of 2 ft with a water column of 90 cm, approximating the tension at field capacity. The content of soil moisture was recorded by Prosser's irro- meters, at 6 and 18 in. depths, Reinhart's fiberglass units, at depths of 1, 2, and 3 ft, and occasional gravimetric determinations. Recordings were made at intervals of one week, or more frequently. Precipitation data were obtained from the Griffith State Nursery, 14 miles dis- tant.
 The microbiological activity of soil was appraised on the basis of carbon dioxide evolution, measured in situ by 6 "spratainer" samplers and a Trico vacuum pump driven by a 6-volt storage battery (Wallis and Wilde 1957). The decomposition of surface organic matter was estimated by periodic weighings of litter, sampled by a steel frame on one foot square areas selected at random.
 Air permeability was determined by a permeameter of Tanner and Wengel (1957), analyses being made 24 hrs
