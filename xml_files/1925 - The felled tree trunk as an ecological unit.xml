 THE FELLED TREE TRUNK AS AN ECOLOGICAL UNIT

 Division of Entomology, University of Minnesota
 <Node id="1586"/>When we speak today of ecological environments we usually think of ex-
 tensive geographic or formational units. This is a very natural attitude in a comparatively new field, such as ecology, where many of the broader aspects of the science are still almost unexplored. At the same time we cannot escape the realization that each of the larger ecological units is composed of
 many smaller units, and that it is only by the detailed study of these smaller
 parts that we can ultimately come to a full understanding of the complex factors comprising the more extensive associations.<Node id="2167"/>
<Node id="2168"/> In many instances these small units are ecological entities as distinct from
 one another as the association of which they are a part is different from other
 associations.<Node id="2341"/> This paper is a discussion of one of these smaller ecological units, the felled tree trunk.
 The fauna and flora comprising the living population of a log is distinctly
 characteristic of this environment. The living things that find in the log food, shelter, and opportunity for the reproduction of their kind are as well
 adapted for the specific conditions in which they live as are those organisms that live in any other environment.<Node id="2779"/> Furthermore, there is a definite succes-
 sion of organisms as the chemical and physical character of the wood changes during the process of disintegration and decay. There is a regular progres- sion from truly wood eating (xylophagous) forms toward an association of
 organisms characteristic of the duff strata of forest soils.<Node id="3109"/> In a brief paper
 of this character it is impossible to cover adequately this complete ecological
 succession, so we shall confine ourselves here to a discussion of the primary or xylophagous stage. In this stage of succession insects and fungi hold the
 center of the stage with the other organisms playing a minor r6le, whereas in the last stages of decomposition the bacteria are probably of major impor- tance.
 <Node id="3526"/>The primary organisms of the xylophagous stage are those that are able
 to digest and assimilate the food materials available in the freshly cut log. These forms intergrade imperceptibly into the second stage of the succession
 which is composed of organisms that cannot convert sound wood into living protoplasm, but are dependent upon the primary forms to modify the food
 material in such a manner that it becomes available.<Node id="3953"/> <Node id="3954"/>Thus without the xy-
 lophagous organisms the food materials within the log would remain securely
 locked up, and the development of the succeeding stages would be impossible.<Node id="4129"/>
<Node id="4130"/> One of the important factors controlling the presence and distribution of life
 within the log is the presence and availability of suitable food materials.<Node id="4286"/>
 THE DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS IN THE LOG AS REGULATED BY FOOD FACTORS
 The character of food varies decidedly in different parts of the log. The
 proteins are concentrated in the living tissues that compose the inner bark
 and cambium, whereas carbohydrates are found abundantly in the xylem.
 <Node id="4580"/>Generally speaking, the dryer and more heavily dignified heart-wood is more
 difficult to digest than the sapwood<Node id="4693"/>. <Node id="4695"/>Thus it is that each portion of the log
 is characterized by certain definite groups of insects, and their individual
 numbers are more or less proportional to the availability of the food ma-
 terial. <Node id="4897"/>The inner bark and cambium furnish the most nutritious material,
 and therefore this layer is promptly infested and swarms with insect life.
 By the end of the first season it usually has been completely worked over.
 Next to the cambium region the sapwood appears to be the favorite feeding ground. Then comes the heartwood and finally the outer bark.
<Node id="5250"/> The insects that work in the cambium fall naturally into two groups:
 those that spend all, and those that spend only a part of their developmental period in this region. <Node id="5422"/>The first group is typified by the bark beetles (Ipidae).
 These insects are dependent throughout their life upon the fresh green tissues
 of the inner bark and cambium. This requirement limits specifically the
 length of the feeding period of these insects. <Node id="5681"/>They must of necessity de-
 velop rapidly while the perishable material upon which they feed remains suitable for them. They must make use of it before it becomes dry, and before other organisms have altered its chemical and physical nature. There-
 fore these are comparatively short lived insects that require at most only a
 few weeks for development.<Node id="6035"/>
 The second group of cambium feeders is somewhat less limited in its food
 requirements. This group is typified by many Cerambycids and Buprestids.
 These insects require green tissue for their young stages, but are able, after
 getting well started, to continue their growth and development in the solid
 wood. Apparently their digestive powers increase with age until finally they
 are able to digest cellulose and convert it into living protoplasm. Then come insects with still stronger powers of digestion, insects that
 from the time of hatching are able to gain a living in solid wood. This group
 is well illustrated by the family Siricidae, the horntails.
<Node id="6700"/> The outer bark is perhaps the portion of a log most resistant to the forces
 of disintegration and decay.<Node id="6806"/> But even the bark furnishes food for certain insects. <Node id="6861"/>These are for the most part little known species and belong to the
 orders Lepidoptera and Diptera. They will not be considered here.<Node id="6994"/> Along with the insects that are characteristic of each of these regions of

 the log are <Node id="7291"/>fungi. These are usually of the wood rotting or wood staining types. Like the insects they are typical of the region in which they occur.
 In some cases there is a distinct symbiotic relationship between wood inhabit-
 ing insects and fungi, as in the case of the ambrosia beetles; and in many
 other instances a looser type of symbiosis can be demonstrated.<Node id="7649"/> <Node id="7650"/>The fungi,
 however, will not be discussed in this paper except to say that they play an
 important part in the nutrition of certain wood-boring insects, and form an
 important link in the chain of ecological succession within the log.<Node id="7885"/>
 From the foregoing brief discussion it is evident that food conditions de-
 termine to a large degree the distribution of insects within a log. <Node id="8031"/>On the
 other hand, however, certain species do not occur in all portions of the log
 where suitable food is to be found. There are other limiting factors that
 effectively shut out some species from certain parts.<Node id="8245"/>
 <Node id="8247"/>Since the summer of 1920 experiments on the effect of certain of these
 limiting factors have been conducted at the University of Minnesota Forestry
 School, at Itasca Park, and some of the data collected during that period will
 be presented in this paper<Node id="8503"/>. I<Node id="8506"/>n these experiments log of five different spe-
 cies have been used: White pine Pinus strobus, Norway pine Pinus resinosa,
 jack pine Pinus banksiana, white spruce Picea canadensis, and balsam fir Abies balsameea. A fresh set of logs was cut each spring, and each set was treated in a similar manner. Every season about thirty logs of each species
 were cut, all on the same day, and were all handled in the same way until
 they were placed in position for experimentation. They were divided into five groups, and each group was placed under a different environmental con- dition. One set was covered with brush, three sets with lath shades exclud- ing respectively three fourths, one half, and one third of the direct sunlight, and the fifth set was placed unprotected in the open. All the logs lay with their length extending north and south. The north end was raised slightly
 and the south end rested on the ground. Records of subcortical temperature in different logs, air temperature, relative humidity, evaporating power of the air, and light were kept throughout the experiment. At the end of each season counts of emergence holes were made, and at the end of the fourth year a vertical longitudinal section was sawed from each log. One edge of
 these sections was on the upper side and the other on the lower side of the
 logs as they had lain during the experimental period. These sections were carefully examined and the holes made by each species or group of insects in
 the different parts were recorded. These data, combined with the records of
 emergence from different parts of the logs, made it possible to arrive at fairly
 definite conclusions concerning the influence of certain external factors upon
 the distribution of the insects within the log.<Node id="10275"/>

 THE EFFECT OF MOISTURE UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS IN LOGS
 One of the important factors affecting insects in logs is moisture. From
 the beginning of these experiments the importance of this factor was recog-
 nized, but <Node id="10700"/>unfortunately the difficulties involved in the frequent and accurate
 measurement of the moisture conditions in different parts of the logs<Node id="10839"/> were never overcome.

 It was possible, however, by raising one end of each log off the ground, to produce a moisture gradient that would show in a rough way the effect of this factor upon the organisms in the log. The lower side of the south end of each log, where it rested upon the ground, approached the point of water saturation whereas the raised north end was comparatively dry. On the upper side of the log it was impossible to maintain an extremely high moisture content in any part; but a moisture gradient, less steep than on the lower side, existed between the ends and the part between. <Node id="12015"/>The existence of these moisture gradients is almost obvious, but the point was checked by weighing, evaporating to dryness and again weighing samples from different parts of the log. It was f ound that the moisture content of the logs varied from day to day depending upon atmospheric conditions. For this reason the data on the effect of moisture here presented are comparative, and al-
 though they do not represent a definite or constant degree of moisture, the relative conditions in the different parts of the log are clearly shown.<Node id="12552"/>

<Node id="12761"/> Species of the genus Asentum are abundant on the lower side of logs, and their distribution illustrates well the effect of the moisture gradient on the under side. <Node id="12926"/>The distribution of Monocharnus offers a similar illustration
 for the upper side. <Node id="13009"/>Figure i shows the comparative abundance of these
 genera in the different portions of the logs.<Node id="13105"/> The steepest moisture gradient
 is found in logs lying in full sunlight. On the lower side of these logs the
 temperature is well within the range of tolerance of the log inhabiting insects.
 Therefore the Asemtum curve is based upon logs in full sun. On the upper
 side, however, temperature becomes a limiting factor, as will be shown later.
 For this reason it was necessary to base the Monochamus moisture curve upon
 logs in partial shade. One third shade satisfied the requirements. The fig-
 ures are based upon averages of all the pine logs in the given shade (full sun,
 6o logs-one third shade, 40 logs). The logs were divided into consecutively
 numbered sections as illustrated at the top of figure i.<Node id="13819"/> Examination of the
 graph shows that Asemuln is comparatively scarce in the driest section, and
 increases in abundance as the moisture increases. It reaches its maximum
 in section 4, passes its optimum and drops off somewhat in the very moist
 section 5. On the top side Monochamus likewise is at its maximum in sec- tion 4, and is least abundant in the driest portions. The other insects in the
 log are also affected by this moisture gradient, but space here will not permit
 further illustration of this point. It is obvious from these data that moisture
 conditions have a profound effect upon the activities of insects in logs.<Node id="14454"/>
 THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS IN LOGS
 Although food and moisture are very important in the life of log insects,
 there are other factors that also should not be overlooked. Among these the
 most obvious is temperature. This is such an important factor that in many
 instances it overshadows and overwhelms all others. It has been discussed
 fully in previous articles and so only the salient features will be briefly re-
 viewed here.
<Node id="14921"/> Often we think of the insect in a log as living in a buffer medium, pro-
 tected by the bark from extreme fluctuations of temperature and moisture. It
 is true that the bark retards evaporation and in this way does help to maintain
 uniform moisture conditions. But its importance in maintaining uniform
 temperature conditions is a negligible quantity, except perhaps when it is ex- trernely thick. On comparatively thin barked logs, such as were used in this experiment, the subcortical temperature shows far wider fluctuations than
 does the air. At night and on cloudy days the temperature within the log becomes approximately that of the surrounding air. When the sun is shin- ing, however, the subcortical temperature on the upper side of white pine logs
 may frequently exceed greatly that of the air, and may sometimes reach a
 temperature of sixty degrees Centigrade, which is far above the fatal tem<Node id="15831"/>-

 perature of all log inhabiting insects. The temperature on the lower side is much more uniform and follows that of the air rather closely. The sub- cortical temperature is affected by the intensity of solar radiation, the angle of incidence of the sun's rays, the color, thickness and structure of the bark, evaporation from the bark surface, air movement, relative humidity and the temperature of the surrounding air. But the intensity of solar radiation ap- pears to be by far the most important of all of these.

This graph illustrates the comparative temperature in similar logs under different environmental conditions. It is apparent at a glance that there is a distinct gradation in temperature from full sun to full shade. It should also be mentioned that the subcortical temperature on the

 <Node id="17962"/>lower side is similar to that of logs in full shade. The full shade condition
 is represented in the graph by the dotted line. The figures along the lower edge of the graph indicate the maximum excess of subcortical temperature over the temperature of the air. It is evident that the intensity of solar radiation is a better index of subcortical temperature in logs than is air tem-
 perature.<Node id="18355"/> The data presented in these graphs shows clearly that on the upper side of logs lying in the open temperature is an important limiting factor.
 Thus in the log there is a wide range of temperature, and naturally the distribution of the insects is influenced decidedly by this variety of conditions. The heat loving forms such as Chrysobothris and other Buprestids are found only in the warmer parts. On the other hand Asemum, Pissodes, Hylurgops, and other species which cannot endure extremes of heat are found only in
 the cooler portions of the log. The following figures illustrate graphically the distribution of the different forms under a variety of conditions.
<Node id="19025"/> In estimating the abundance and distribution of the insects in different
 parts of the log two methods were used; and in the case of several species it was possible to check one of these against the other. One set of data were based upon the number of holes made by each species or group of species in different portions of the vertical longisections referred to above. The other set of distribution data was based upon counts of exit holes in different parts of the logs. In general the two methods check out well except in a case like Monochemus which has a strong tendency to emerge on the upper side re- gardless of where in the Jog it has been working. These data were all re- duced to common terms, the square foot was adopted as the unit area.<Node id="19776"/>
 <Node id="19778"/>Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 illustrate the distribution of Monochamus in differ- ent parts of logs under various conditions of light.<Node id="19906"/> The curves representing this genus in white pine, Norway pine, and spruce are very similar. On the upper side Monochamus is at its maximum abundance in full shade and at the minimum in full sun. In the middle and bottom sections of the log the re- verse is true. In jack pine, however, there was practically no infestation in full shade even on the upper side. Whether this is a condition that is al- ways characteristic of jack pine as a species, or whether it is one of those un- explainable coincidences against which we must always be on our guard in biological work, can only be shown by further investigations. In general it is evident from these curves that <Node id="20572"/>M1onochamus finds the most favorable con- ditions for its development under from fifty to seventy five per cent direct sunlight. Norway pine because of its thick, flaky, comparatively light colored bark, never reaches such extremely high temperatures as does white pine. Thus it is that in Norway pine the most favorable conditions occur under seventy five per cent light, whereas in white pine and jack pine the optimum is reached in fifty per cent light.

 logs in full sun and more rarely on the upper portions of logs in partial shade.
 Under complete shade the infestation is reduced to practically nil. Both moisture and temperature appear to play important parts in regulating within the logs the distribution of this genus of beetles.
 The Siricidae work deep in the wood and are for this reason much less subject to sudden temperature changes than are the other insects thus far considered. They do, however reflect to a lesser degree the same reaction to high temperatures on the upper side of logs in full sun as do the others. Also

 they show a marked reaction to the cool conditions under heavy shade. Fig- ures I2, I3, and i8 show how, up to a certain point, these insects become more
 abundant, pass their optimum and are again reduced in numbers as light in- creases.
 Chryobothris is the most heat-resistant of any insect observed during the course of these experiments. The members of this genus live only on the upper side of logs where they are exposed to the greatest extremes of heat
 and cold. Figure I4 shows how their numbers are greatly reduced by even a slight amount of shade. Figure i9 shows how all the Bupresitids, of which Chrysobothris was the predominant genus in the experimental logs, occur most abundantly in the warmest parts.
 Pissodes, Rhagium, and Pytho, illustrated in figures I5 and i6, favor the cooler locations. It is only in very heavy shade that they occur at all upon the upper side of logs. Even on the side and bottom their numbers are de-
 cidedly reduced as the light and bleat increase.
<Node id="24981"/> Bark beetles, of the family Ipidae, are perhaps the group of insects most typical of the freshly cut logs. It is indeed a rarity to find a log left ex- posed during the season of activity that is not infested with some of these
 beetles. <Node id="25220"/>Like the other insects in the log they respond in a very definite manner to environmental conditions and their distribution within the log is therefore strictly regulated by the physical environment.<Node id="25419"/>
 <Node id="25421"/>Figure I7 shows how bark beetles are most abundant on the upper side of
 logs lying in twenty five per cent sunlight, and on the sides in fifty per cent.<Node id="25574"/>
 These beetles, except for a few genera like Hylurgops, are never -found very abundantly on the lower side of logs. This is due of course not only to low temperature but also to excessive moisture.
 Thus the temperature within the log has an important influence in deter- mining the part of the log attacked by the different groups of xylophagous insects. On the upper portions of logs in full sunlight are those species that
 are able to endure extremes of temperature, on the sides species with inter- mediate temperature requirements and on the bottom only those species that prefer cool conditions.
 As the intensity of light is decreased by shade the extreme fluctuations of temperature no longer occur, and the heat-loving forms drop out and are
 replaced on the upper side by less heat-resistant species. Finally many of the species found only on the lower side of logs in full sun occur quite com- monly on the upper side in complete shade.
<Node id="26524"/> Temperature, in addition to its regulating effect upon the distribution of insects in logs is also important in its influence upon the rate of development of xylophagous insects.<Node id="26703"/> Much has been written in recent years of the effect of this factor upon the rate of insect development. We would naturally expect development to be much more rapid with insects that work in logs

 exposed to the sun than in those in the shade, and in the experiments under discussion we were not disappointed in our expectations.
 For instance, Monochamus scutellatus in the sun completes its develop-
 ment in one year whereas in heavy shade it may require three full years for
 it to pass from egg to adult. The effect of cool conditions upon Monochamus
 is clearly shown by the data obtained from the logs in this experiment. In
 warm situations the maximum amount of damage was done during the first
 season, whereas in full shade many of the larvae had not entered the wood
 at the end of the first year. <Node id="29406"/>Between first and second year logs in full shade
 there was the following difference in the average number of holes per square
 foot: first year I.7 holes, second year 4.5 holes.<Node id="29584"/>
 SOME OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ACTIVITIES OF INSECTS IN LOGS
 <Node id="29652"/>From the foregoing discussion it might be inferred that the factors food,
 moisture, and temperature determine entirely the activities of insects in logs. To leave such an impression would be erroneous. These factors determine
 to a very marked degree the locations in which the different species of xy-
 lophagous insects can exist, but there are also other influential factors of
 which we know little. The data presented here are averages, and show what
 we may expect to find in general. But there are many phenomena that can-
 not be explained on the basis of the data at hand. For instance, why will
 one log be heavily infested with insects and another similar log from the same species of tree lying next it remain practically uninfested? Time and time again we see cases where bark beetles have selected for attack without any
 apparent reason, a particular log or tree, and left others under identical con- ditions, so far as we can see, untouched. The same is true of Monochamus, Chrysobothris, Siricids, Asemum, and other groups of wood borers.<Node id="30708"/>
 Is it a chemotropic response that results in this selection? Is it the result
 of a primitive development of the social instinct that brings about this con- centration in certain logs? Is it because of variations in wood density, the proportion of heart to sapwood, or the thickness, or structure of the cortical layers that influences selection? We are forced, for the present, to leave these questions unanswered. There appears to be little doubt, however, that in dealing with a large number of logs the most important factors influencing
 the activities of insects are those that have been considered above, i.e., food, moisture, and temperature; but variation in individual logs must often be explained in some other way. Here is a fertile field for future investigation.
 THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF OUR ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF
 LOG INSECTS
 The knowledge of the distribution of insects in logs and of the factors controlling this distribution have an important bearing on the control of xy-

 lophagous insects. By handling freshly cut logs in such a manner as to maintain conditions unfavorable to insect development much valuable timber can be saved. Examination of the data presented in this paper shows very marked reduction of insect activity in complete shade. Also in complete shade the rate of development and likewise the rate of injury is reduced under low temperature conditions. Thus it is evident that we have at our command a possibility of practical control hitherto almost disregarded.
 These studies in the distribution of insects in logs have other important practical features. For instance it has been shown that Monocharmus under shade conditions becomes concentra<Node id="32610"/>ted on the upper side of logs. If this fact were taken into consideration in sawing logs infested with this insect a great saving of high grade lumber could be accomplished.<Node id="32783"/> Without doubt other possibilities of a practical nature will result from a continuation of in- vestigations along these lines.
 SUMMARY
 I. The log is an ecological unit with a distinctly characteristic and well adapted population.
 2. There is a definite succession of organisms in the log as the chemical and physical character of the wood changes during the processes of disinte- gration and decay, beginning with xylophagous forms and concluding with an association of organisms characteristic of the duff strata of forest soils.
 3. In this paper only the xylophagous stage is considered. 4. The primary organisms of the xylophagous stage are those that are
 able to digest and assimilate the food material available in a green log, and they grade into the second stage which is dependent upon the primary organ- isms to modify the food materials for their use.
 5. The distribution of insects in logs is regulated by many factors of which food, moisture, and temperature appear on the average most important.
 6. On the basis of food requirements log insects may be grouped as cambium, cambium-wood, wood, and bark dwellers.
 7. Along with insects that are typical of each region of the log are fungi that are equally typical of the parts where they occur.
 8. In some cases, as with the ambrosia beetles, there is a close symbiotic relationship between insects and fungi. In other instances there exists a looser type of symbiosis.
 9. The effect of moisture upon the development of insects in logs is im- portant and determines to a considerable degree their distribution.
 IO. Subcortical temperatures have greater fluctuations than have air tem- peratures.
 i i. Subcortical temperature varies directly with the intensity of solar radiation.
 12. Temperature determines to a large extent the distribution of log in- sects. The heat resisting species occur on the top side and those preferring cooler temperatures on the under side of logs in full sun.

 I3. Many of the species found only on the lower side of logs in the sun
 occur on all sides of logs in the shade.
 I4. There appears to be little doubt that in dealing with a large number
 of logs the most important factors influencing the activities of insects are
 food, moisture and temperature, but variations in the degree of infestation
 of individual logs must often be explained on the basis of some other factor
 such as chemotropic responses, density of wood, or character of bark.
 I5. A knowledge of the distribution and the factors regulating this dis-
 tribution of insects in logs has important practical significance in the control of wood-boring insects.
 i6. Full shade reduces the amount of infestation of most insects and the
 rate of development of all wood-boring species.
 i7. In some cases the localization of injury by wood-boring species makes
 possible the saving of considerable amounts of high grade materials by in-
 telligent sawing of logs.
