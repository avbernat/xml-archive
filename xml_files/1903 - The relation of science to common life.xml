 THE RELAT1ON O}' SCIENCE TO COMMON
 LIFE.*
 I HAVE been honored by being seleeted
 to speak to you on the present oeeasion.
 * Sigma Xi Soeiety address, June 18, 1903,
 before the ehapter of the University of Penn- . . /
 sylvanla.
<Node id="4732"/> The high ideals of this society demand that
 I should attempt to leave my restricted
 field of study for a time, and that I should
 speak of those broader questions that agi-
 tate general scientific thought-that I
 should drop the role of the botanist, and
 assume that of the scientist and the man.<Node id="5033"/>
 My theme is 'The Relation of Science to
 Common Ijife,'<Node id="5090"/> the life of the mass of in-
 dividuals, of the nation, if you will. A
 very unacademic subject, you will say,<Node id="5200"/> as
 measured by the older. standards. I chose
 it on that account. In not a few univer-
 sity centers, the time has not long gone
 when such <Node id="5342"/>a subject would have been
 cur.tly dismissed with the remark, ' We
 have nothing to do with common life; we
 follow our own high educational aims. '
 Too often the universities have stood aside
 in cold and unsympathetic isolation shall
 I not also say in helpless disfavor while
 the busy thinking world outside has carried
 forward the beacon lights of truth and
 progress.<Node id="5717"/> I listen to<Node id="5729"/> Whewell when, as
 Master of Trinity College (Cambridge),
 he went up to London fifty years ago to
 deliver his notable address before the Royal
 Institution. Speaking on 'The Influence
 of the History of Science upon Intelleetual
 Edueation,'<Node id="5972"/> he said: "I venture to address
 you, relying upon an indulgence which I
 have more than once experieneed. Of such
 indulgence I strongly feel the need, on
 various aecounts, but especially that, being
 so unfrequently in this metropolis, I do not
 know what trains of thought are passing
 in the minds of the greater. part of my
 audience who live in the midst of a stimu-
 lation produced by the lively interchange
 of opinion and diseussion on the prominent
 questions of the day. " Uttered soon after
 the exhibition of 185S, and when the seien-
 tific world was entering on new conquests,
 such an apology may seem unaccountable.
<Node id="6607"/> Happilyn our university presidents of to-
day are more in touch with the throbbing vibrating life of humanity, even though they may not elaim the p}ofundity of thought that lived in the zllaster of ' Trinity. '<Node id="6818"/>
<Node id="6819"/> If there be one eharaeteristie more than another of our age and day, it is the steady welding and eooperative development pro- eeeding among the leading races of the world. Nowhere is this seen on so phe- nomenal a scale as in our country, where, with the Anglo-Celt, Jew and Greek Frank and German, Italian and Norsenzar together ply the arts of peace.<Node id="7173"/> And why such a commingling of human lives ? The answer may be given, and so far well, that here liberty is assured to all, that equal rights and equal opportanities come to all. <Node id="7352"/>Back of this, however, is the basie fact that in this country scientifie progress has been comparatively wlhampered by costly patent laws, by hereditary vested rights, by lands being held in the hands of a few<Node id="7561"/>. But perhaps above all7 and permeating all, though often silently working, <Node id="7637"/>there exists a keen and rapid method of inductive reasoning that carries forward the individual and the community on progressive and yet safe lines. It is this method, applied to all branehes of seienee with inereasing exaet- ness, as human freedoul inereasingly as- serted itself during the bygone centuryn whieh has eulminated in the marvelous sci- entifie position occupied by the country to-day.<Node id="8036"/>
 <Node id="8038"/>Ollr Sigma Ni Society, as a university organization, stands for ' the nobility of science.'<Node id="8129"/> What then is its relation to the university on the one hand, and to the common life of mankind on the other? In reply, let me quickly review the growth of universities during <Node id="8305"/>the past millennium. <Node id="8326"/>With Laeroix we may regard the <Node id="8357"/>University of Paris<Node id="8376"/> as the first great efifort made by <Node id="8412"/>Abelard<Node id="8419"/> and his suecessors to dispel the
 shades of the dark ages.<Node id="8478"/> Here in the four nations met scholars of every language, creed and degree of poverty or wealth. A thirst for learning was their common bond. Later the Universities of Bolognav Padua and Oxford widened and deepened the channel of democratic learnings that spread out and vivifed Europe.<Node id="8764"/> It is notewor.thy that amid all the machinations of emper- ors, kings, popes and knights <Node id="8854"/>the fearless champions of freedom of thought, and so of freedom of the individual, from the tenth to the fourteenth eentury, issued from the universities, and were often more powerful, and more feared by autocratic rulers, than armed hosts.<Node id="9094"/>
<Node id="9095"/> But the appearanee in sueccssion of Galileo, Franeis Baeon, Deseartes and New- ton, with many lesser lights clustered round, gave rise to that comparatively re- cent university <Node id="9273"/>renaissanee<Node id="9284"/> which is spread- ing to widest proportions in our own land and time. <Node id="9354"/>We owe it almost wholly <Node id="9378"/>to the close pursuit of accurate inductive, seien- tifie methods, which have yielded deduc-tions of profoundest value. By slow de- grees, through observation and experiment, fact has been cumulated on fact, till these have, in their combined perfection, per- mitted some great hypothesis to be ad- vanced, or some great law to be deduced, that has grouped all lesser laws in crystal- like symmetry.<Node id="9776"/>
 <Node id="9778"/>But only after the biologiGal induetions and deduetions of Lamarck, Speneer, Wal- lace and Darwin were we in position to apply seientifie methods to living things, to man himself. <Node id="9958"/>One fulldamental keynote of their teaGhings is that 'Use vindicates and prolongs existenee. ' <Node id="10052"/>The cry is still raised, though from a scattered remnant that is fst being left in the rear of educational progress, that utilitarianism is disastrous to university education and to highest scholarship. This remnant desires to retain the exclusive spirit and sectarian bigotry that characterized some universities, which had started well but unfortunately were 'captured' for a time by a priviledged and unrepresentative few, from the sixteenth to the nineteeth centruy.<Node id="10522"/> <Node id="10523"/>John Bright dubbed one of these institu- tions with eutting but deserved sarcasm as 'the home of dead languages and of un- dying prejudices. '<Node id="10665"/>
 <Node id="10667"/>Science knows no such distinctions, and refuses to reeognize them. She writes deeply on the warp and woof of human and of all organie existenee the law that utility conserves, strengthens and continues life, that disuse weeds out and destroys.<Node id="10910"/> <Node id="10911"/>I glory then in the utilitarian, which in the recently gone century has stirred our common human life to titanic action in every field, has revivified and advaneed true edueation, has sown broadeast eolleges and universities, and has sent forth from these enthusiastie disciples aglow with the
 spirit of researeh and of experiment. <Node id="11244"/>This
 young eentury, then, before its death, will witness mighty seientifie aehievement, eom-
 pared with whieh all that has been un- folded will be only the prelude.
 But here let us linger over the terms
 use, utility, utilitarianism. It is easy to
 distort and miseonstrue their precise scien- tifie signifieance. <Node id="11561"/>When one looks with the botanieal eye<Node id="11598"/> at those large, bright-
 blue marginal florets of the eorn-flower, and diseovers in them neither stamens nor carpels for fruit produetion, one is apt to
 exclaim hastily: ' They are useless, they have no claim to existenee. ' But pa-tienee tells us to wateh, to observe and to learn how these attraet passing insect visitors to the small inconspicuous central floretsy whith by aid of the attratted visitors set abundant fruits. The marginal florets seeln at first gaudy superfluities, but though they have only one use in life like the
 leader of men who had otlee blacked shoes, they can all ecaim: 'Didn't I do it well?? Every scientifie fact is useful, but may not neeessarily be used. As Darwin patient]y dissected cirripeds, studied and deseribed the strueture of orehid blooms, observed the slow revolutions of twining plan)ts, counted the number of seeds that different plants might produce, a finaneial speeulator estaped from the unhallowed bedlam of the stock exthange, and looking in on the sage in his quiet country home at the week's end to cool his nerves, might have deelared it all a waste of time and labor. <Node id="12725"/>We know that Darwin was laying the foundations of those prineiples that^have rqevo- lutionized all thouglit, and that he was paving the way for the economic death of this speculating friend, who biologically is a human parasite.<Node id="12953"/>
 What relation then has seienee, and
 should it have, to our universities on the one han.d, and to common life-to the mass of free, earnest thinking people, on the other? In attempting to answer we must
 constantly keep in view tradition and his- tory our relation to our aneestors, real or imaginary. We all,like the Chinese, worship
 these aneestorqs- at least in their relations and theyworship them most powerfully who
 arefurthestremoved from theland thatgave
 them birth. So it is that we fear to break with the past, and inherit incongruous com- binations. <Node id="13518"/>Says Whewell in the leetur.e
 already referred to: "You will not be sur- prised to be told that our modern edueation
 has derived something from the antient
 Greek edutation, betause you know that our modern scienee has derived muth fr.om the aneient Greek seienee. You know that our seienee-in the ordinary sense of the term -has derived little from the aneient Romans. * * * But if we take the term scienee in a somewhat 'wide' acceptation, we shall derive from the Roman history not a negative but a positive esemplifieation of our proposition.<Node id="14065"/>

<Node id="14067"/>For in that wider sense there ts a seienee of which Rome was the mother, as Greeee was of geometry
 and mathematies.<Node id="14183"/> The term science may be extended so widely as to allow us to speak of the seienee of law meaning the doetrine of r.ights and obligations, <Node id="14322"/>in its most definite and yet most Gomprehensive form; in short the seienee of jurispru- denee. * * * And thus two of the great elements of a thorough intelleetual culture- mathematies and jurisprudenee are an inheritanee whith we derive from ages long gone by; from the two great nations of antiquity. "<Node id="14625"/>
<Node id="14626"/> So far <Node id="14634"/>Whewell<Node id="14641"/>, who in attempting to
 elevate Roman law to the dignity of a SGi- enee forgot that muGh of it was unseien-
 tifie to the last degree, and tended to pro-
 duee, not organie national equilibrium, but to set the patricians against the plebeians,
 and both against the bondmen, who often showed finer qualities than either. Little wonder is it that Rome fell, unsaved by her laws.<Node id="15018"/>
 Let us see whether a different viewpoint
 and souree of origin for the science of law
 and equally for all stientifie relations might not be obtaineFd. <Node id="15172"/>Huxley<Node id="15178"/> thus puts it: "It is a ver.y plain and elementary truth that the life, the fortune and the happiness of every one of us and, more or less, of those who are connected with us, do depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a game infinitely more diffieult and compli- eated than chess. It is a game whith has been played for untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two players in a game of his or her own. The thess board is the world, the pietes are the phe- nomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we eall the laws of nature. * * * Edueation is learning the rules of this mighty game. In other words education is the instruetion of the intelleet in the laws of nature, under whiGh name I inelude not merely things and their forces, but men and their ways; and the fashioning of the affections and of the will into an earnest and loving desire to move in har- mony with those laws. * * *<Node id="16103"/> <Node id="16104"/>The object of what we commonly eall education-that education in which man intervenes and whith I shall distinguish as artifitial eduea- tion is.to make good defects in nature's methods, to prepare the child to reeeive nature's edueation. * * * In short all ar- tifieial edutation ought to be an antitipa- tion of natural edueation. And a liberal edueation is an artifieial edueation whiGh has not only prepared a man to eseape the great evils of disobedienee to natural laws, <Node id="16580"/>but has trained him to appreeiate and to seize upon the rewards whiGh nature seat- ters with as free a hand as her penalties<Node id="16704"/>.<Node id="16705"/> " <Node id="16708"/>To pursue Huxley's reasoning to its ulti- mate limit, advaneed teaGhing of all the
 laws of nature is the highest funetion of the university in relation to our Gommon life. <Node id="16881"/>In other words to make eaeh man who leaves its por.tals most highly qualified for useful, intelleetual, manly life<Node id="16995"/>.<Node id="16996"/> But, as I hope to show later, this qualifieation is to
 enable him to use wisely- not meanly- the
 forees around him, so as to build soeiety
 e
 nto an organlsm.
 <Node id="17160"/>Therefore, every upright pursuit in life whiGh man enters on should have the high- est printiples and practice governing it represented and taught in our universities, by the best men in the most perfectly equipped manner.<Node id="17382"/> This may be an ideal at present. Granted, it is nevertheless one toward whieh, I am persuaded, every uni- versity must move. In this manner stienee wrill confer the dignity that is deserved on the physieian's sealpel, the brieklayer's trowel, the ehemist 's test-tube, the engi- neer's lathe, the biologist's miGrOSGOpe, the

 agrieulturist's spade or ploughshare. When
 he saw the spirit of destruetion honored and
 that of construetion lightly esteemed<Node id="17837"/>, <Node id="17839"/>Car-
 lyle<Node id="17849"/> rightly growled out as follows in his
 immortal <Node id="17898"/>'Sartor Resartus<Node id="17914"/>': "The Hinter-
 sehlag professors knew syntax enough, and
 of the human soul this much: that it has
 a faculty ealled memory, and could be
 acted on through the museular integuments
 by applicance of birch rods. Alas ! so it is
 everywhere, so will it ever be, till an archz-
 tect is hired, and on all hands fitly en-
 touraged; till communities and individuals
 discover, not without surprise, that fash-
 ioning the souls of a generation by knowl-
 edge ean rank oh a level with blowing their
 bodies to pieees by gunpowder; that with
 generals and field-marshals for killing,
 there should be world-honored dignitaries,
 and, were it possible, true Gkod-ordained
 priests, for teaGhing. But as yet, though
 the soldier wears openly and even parades
 his butehering tool, nowhere, far as I have
 travelled, did the sehoolmaster make show
 of his instrueting tool; nay, were he to
 walk abroad with bireh girt on thigh, as if
 he therefrom expeeted honor, would there
 not, among the idler elass, perhaps a cer-
 tain levity be exGited ? "<Node id="18956"/> Happily the
 twentieth eentury gives promise of emanei-
 pation alike from the marshal's sword and
 the dominie's rod.<Node id="19075"/> <Node id="19076"/>It is for us to strug-
 gle toward securing that honored recogni-
 tion for every branch of knowledge whieh
 Carlyle dimly presaged.
 It has often been urged that the intru-
 sion of so-ealled technieal seienee into our
 universities will break up all cherished
 university ideals and dissipate the poetic
 side of life.<Node id="19396"/> Both objeetions are equally
 erroneous. Even in acquiring the most
 tethnical detail of stience, <Node id="19494"/>the student can
 still exelaim with Kepler, in all humility
 and dignity: 'O God, I think thy thoughts
 after Thee.'<Node id="19610"/>
<Node id="19611"/> And as to real poetry and romance, sci-
 enee is just beginning to unfold such. You
 will forgive me, as a botanist, while I tell
 you of the wonder and pleasure our stu-
 dents expressed about a month ago, when
 earried past Jersey fields of scarlet clover
 in full bloom. This plant had converted
 former sandy wastes into a floral paradise.
 But more, our workers had learned the
 reason for its presence in such quantity,
 and could picture to themselves the orig-
 inally scant, but now rapidly multiplying,
 myriads of 'nitromonas' baeteria that were
 absorbing and fixing loose atmospherie
 nitrogenous compounds. They knew that
 these handed on much of this to the Rhz-
 zobtum organism of the soil or of the elo-
 ver tubercles, and that finally the fixed
 assimilated nitrates were utilized by the
 clover for its sustenanee.<Node id="20447"/> Truly a romance
 verified.<Node id="20474"/>
 Let me try to pick up another with you
 from the gutter, and illuminate it with the
 rays of latter-day diseovery. Philadelphia
 every year pours into her rivers millions
 of tons of sewage. As you are aware,
 this is rich in all the chemical pr.oduets
 needed for plant life, but, like every valu-
 able thing, it must be handled earefully.
 We have hitherto called it waste and have
 puzzled our brains how to get rid of it.
 One of our railroad companies has found it
 profitable to build a large viaduet over the
 Delaware to carry our eitizens quiekly to
 the New Jersey toast. No one has yet
 been- enterprising enough to build an
 equally large aqueduet into whiGh our
 sewage might be pumped, and ulti-
 mately distributed over the thirsty
 but capable sands of New Jersey, whieh
 would blossom into life were such given.
 <Node id="21307"/>To apply the statlsties now to hand, 4,000
 aeres of New Jersey land within ten miles
 of Philadelphia could -then be made to

 delphians tonsume, while muth of the sew-
 age water might again be collected, and
 returned to us as hygienie water whiGh
 might well replaGe that of the unregener-
 ate Schuylkill. The correetness of every
 detail of this Berlin has already demon-
 strated in her broad irrigation system.
<Node id="21964"/> In the accomplishment of such truly ro-
 mantic results the schoolman and the lay-
 man, the university teacher and the shop
 worker, have equally had to do.<Node id="22122"/> <Node id="22123"/>Already
 it is reGognized that to prepare, cut, stain
 and microscopically examine a paraffin sec-
 tion, or to separate out the constituents of
 a ehemieal mixture, are both liberal eduea-
 tions in whiGh the skilled hand, eye, nose
 and ear all cooperate with their comples
 and correlated central manifestation that
 we call mind.<Node id="22456"/> <Node id="22457"/>Measured by such methods
 knowledge is not the mental quantity and
 quality supplied by this or that university,
 but is the earnest effort of man to en-
 lighten and guide hilnself and his fellow
 man.<Node id="22659"/>
<Node id="22660"/> As brethren of the Sigma :Si then it
 becomes us to agitate constantly for the
 restoration' of the grand ideals set by Paris
 and Bologna universities of the tenth to
 the fourteenth century. There learning
 was imparted to all who loved it, there
 nationality, or name, or condition formed
 no bar to the owner whose gown at times
 served to cover his rags, and there the
 seholars of their day-courted by emperor
 and entertained by the nobles were the
 teachers of these famous old centers.<Node id="23155"/> Above
 all we should <Node id="23177"/>so school ourselves as to be
 ready to slough off during each un£olding
 year with its new possibilities for prog-
 ress the skin of prejudice or preference
 that may have hardened round us in the
 preceding period. <Node id="23393"/>The biologioal teaching
 of Huxley in '55 was very different from
 that of '75, and this again from that of '90.
 In university life the caution is constantly
 needed. <Node id="23561"/>A reeent magazine number ehron-
 ieled the people's vote of three large eities,
 in favor of muniGipal ownership of dis-
 tributive ageneies, and somewhat pungently
 added: 'While the aeademiGians are diStU
 sing the theory of maniGipal ownership the
 people, in these eities at least, are getting
 into the habit of voting for it.' PeriodiG
 intelleetual molting Gonduees often to
 sound mental life.<Node id="23962"/>
 It is a property of most seientifie ques-
 tions that they projeet themselves into the
 future. Whether we aeeept the teaGhings
 of Kidd's suggestive Gouple of volumes or
 no, his prophetie outlook into the future
 is inspiring, and despite destruetive criti-
 eisms his prineiple of 'projeeted effieieney'
 is one that every true seientist taGitly be-
 lieves in and works up to. We all think
 of leaving the world better for our deseend-
 ants-be they fleshly or mental children
 and the man who asked in selfish uncon-
 cern, ' What has posterity done for me ? '
 deserved no children, and equally deserved
 that his good deeds should be buried with
 him.<Node id="24622"/> Like that of Paul, our life should
 be a conseerated unrest. NVe have not
 yet attained, neither are we already per-
 fect.<Node id="24746"/>
 While it will gladly be conceded that few
 if any countries foster scientifie advance
 more than America, it will as readily be
 conceded that this has been mainly on the
 applied side, and that much remains for
 acconlplishment in non-remunerative edu-
 cational equipment. Here I place in front
 rank the need for spacious and splendidly
 furnished museums for all the sciences.
 Those of uswho havewalked, time and again,

repute-know that we have nothing to compare with them. Suppose we make ob- servation for a time in the mechanical sec- tion, where aecurate models Inay be even see-t at work. <Node id="25745"/>There the schoolboy lingers i;nquiringly before-them, and he thus forms great conceptions of man's inventive rela- tion to the world forees around him. The factory worker learns how his machines have grown, have been evolved, and how he may possibly per.fect them further. For the college and university teacher these collections furnish comparative and con- crete illustrations by which a lasting piG- ture is fixed in the mind.<Node id="26174"/> Such institu- tions are costly to erect' to furnish, to man, and to su?port annually. Their high edu- cational worth must be gauged not by the fruits of years, but of decades anA cen- turies, for the mental stimulus they affor.d is often hidden away and silent. <Node id="26437"/>The ques- tion of cost should be a minor considera- tion in planning suGh undertakings, amld the corporate and individual wealth that characterizes tsuch centers as our own. Civic pride and loyalty, national pride and loyalty, pride in and loyalty to our highest human development should be suffieient impelling foree. <Node id="26756"/>Here let me say, with all caution and r.eserve, but yet with perfect conviction of purpose, that when we read or learn of lavish <Node id="26885"/>individual expenditures, for individual gratifieation alone, it should arouse in every one of us the desire to so mold public opinion that such superfluous ostentations shall cease.<Node id="27066"/> If the owner of the wealth thus diverted can be shown that his wealth can most patriotically be es- pended in building up the country's insti- tutions, then we have suecessfully done bat-tle for the right. If history has lessons for us, does it not remind us that at one phase of Rome 's history the poet could truthfully say,

 Let me suggest another need or couple of needs, easy of fulfilment, and which it be- hooves us as members of the Sigma Xi to supply. I refer to a graduate and under- graduate society or branch of this one, for general scientifie improvement and infor- mation. We as graduates and teachers are, or unfortunately in some respects must be, specialists living and working along narrow grooves. A vigorously and GOm- prehensively planned meeting, held once a month, would refresh and expand us all. Pieture to yourselves a meeting such as we might have had during the past few weeks with an intellectual bill of fare such as the following: ' The Separation and Properties of Radium, '<Node id="28484"/> ' The Biology of Laziness,'<Node id="28512"/> 'The Dotter in Naval Practice,' 'The Organisin of Smallpox,-' 'The Pfhysi- cal Principles involved in the Formation of Mountains' and 'Ijuminolls Bacteria as- a New Illuminant.' <Node id="28691"/>To finish these in a night would afford a meal worthy of men- tal digestion for a month. Such meetings would also promote that esprt de corps, that common effort, that contagious en- thusiasm, that self-sacrifieing spirit, which when combined ensure an institution 's progress.<Node id="28968"/>
 Equally would I urge the need for under- graduate ortanization, though largely for other reasons. Our developing scientists and aspirants to the honors of Sigma Ni should have fullest opportunity for debate, discussion and presentation of views. A

Too litthe attention is often give to form, and too much to sub- stance' in scientifie presentations. <Node id="29720"/>A few sentences back a note of warning was sounded against the dangers of special- ization. I trust that every one directly or indirectly connected with our institutions realizes its dangers. Though Darwin pa- thetically confessed as to its effects, no one has put it more foreefully than<Node id="30008"/> Stuart Mill, who says: " The inereasing specializa- tion of all employments; the division of mankind into innumerable small fractions, each engrossed by an extremely minute fragment of the business of society' is not without inconveniences' as well moral as intellectual, which if they could not be remedied, would be a serious abatement from the benefits of advanced eivilization. The interests of the whole the bearings of things on the ends of the soeial union-are less and less present to the minds of men who have so contracted a sphere of ae- tivity. * * @<Node id="30571"/> This lowering effeet of the extreme division of labor tells most of all on those who are set up as the lights and teaGhers of the rest.<Node id="30707"/> A man's mind is as fatally narrowed, and his feelings towards the great ends of humanity as miserably stunted, by giving all his thoughts to the classifieation of a few inseets' or the reso- lution of a few equations, as to sharpen- ing the points or putting on the heads of pins.<Node id="30988"/> The ' dispersive speeialty ' of the present raGe of seientifie men, who, unlike their predeeessors, have a positive aversion to enlarged views, and <Node id="31137"/>seldom either know or eare for any of the interests of man- kind beyond the narrow limits of their pur- StlitS, is dwelt on by M.

 the great and growing evils of the time, and the one which most retards moral and intellectual regeneration. * <Node id="31395"/>* * Ee de- mands a moral and intellectual aushority charged with the duty of guiding mqn 's opinions and enlightening and warn;og their consciences; a spiritual power whose judgments on all matters of high moment should deserve and receive the same uni- versal respect and deference which is paid to the united judgment of astronomers in matters astronomical. " We must ac- knowledge, to a large degree, the saneness of Mill's position, but if we all cease spe- eializing one day in the seven at least, the spiritual power desiderated will have op- portunity to dwell in our. midst. The Jew- ish Sabbath is by no means the worn-out institution that some would have us believe. 
Another rock ahead in the channel of progress demands most careful considera- tion and steady action. Our present-day political and economie systems often foster methods by which science and scientific discovery are degraded or robbed of their tr.ue value, while the scientifie worker is often defrauded o£ that reward that should come from sturdy effort of mind and hand. It has truly been said that ' era£ty men eon- temn studies, simple men admire them? wise men use them.

 ploited by some erafty unseientifie dealer.
 But to put the whole question on a mueh higher plane than that of mere finaneial
 well-being, I venture to say that sinee
 <Node id="33512"/>seienee stands for aeeuraey, probity, elear
 statement of faet, unveiling of error. of every
 kind whether intentional or unintentional<Node id="33647"/>
 -it ean have no sympathy with the deeeit
 and ehieanery that are so rampant around us, and that threaten at times even to
 swamp the high ideals of our universities.
 Toward the elose of his valuable work on ' The Rise of the Swiss Republie, ' <Node id="33893"/>Mc-
 Craeken<Node id="33905"/> says: "It has beeome somewhat
 of a eommonplaee assertion that polities in
 the United States have reaehed the lowest
 stage\ to whieh they may safely go. There
 seems to be no longer any neeessity to prove
 this proposition, for the general eonvietion
 has gone abroad, amply justified by the
 whole eourse of history, that no demoeraey
 ean hope to withstand the eorrupting in-
 fluenees now at work in our midst, unless
 eertain radieal reforms are earried to a
 sueeessful eonelusion. Our ealm Ameri-
 ean eomplaeeney seems, at length, to have
 reeeived a shoek; our habitual optimism
 to have given plaee to a feeling of appre-
 hension, lest the malignant forees now up-
 permost in our national life may not, after
 all, prove too strong for us; and a eorre-
 sponding desire is being manifested to set
 in motion other benign forees whieh sha]l
 save the state from destruetion while there
 is yet time.
 Unfortunately all attempts to probe the
 fundamental first eauses of our eorruption
 are eheeked at the outset by the diffleulty
 of bringing the popular will to bear upon
 publie questions. Our whole administra-
 tive system, and all the methods by whzeh
 the people are supposed to make known
 their desires, are perverted and diseased, so that the sovereign body are prevented by mere trieksters from eserting their legitZ
 imate eontrol over tht making of tXhe laws
 whieh are to govern them. <Node id="35316"/>We are su:ffer- ing not only from deep-seated eeonomie and
 soeial diseases, of whieh perhaps the most
 alarming symptom is the eoneentration of
 wealth into the hands of a few, but from
 the r.ule of the boss, and from the lament-
 able faet that the people at large are di-
 voreed from legislation. As a matter of
 fatt nothing stands between us and the
 tyranny of munieipal, state and federal
 bosses, as unserupulous as any feudal lord- lings in the thirteenth eentury, exeept pub-
 lie opinion, imperfeetly expressed by the press. "<Node id="35855"/>
 Ilater he says: 'As for the introduetion
 of the r.eferendum and the initiative into
 the United States, there are, in reality,
 no insurmountable obstaeles to bar the -
 way.' And again- "Those who have no
 faith in the prineiples whieh underlie all
 genuine demoeracies, in the equality and
 brotherhood of man, and in his natural
 rights; who fear the people as an unreason-
 ing beast whieh must be eontrolled; and
 therefore look to reform by means of arti-
 fieial laws, rather than by those of nature
 sueh men will naturally dread anything
 whieh savors of direet government, and
 will of eourse find the referendum and the
 initiative a stumbling bloek and a bugbear.
 But the inereasing number of those who
 plaee their utmost eonfidence in the eom-
 mon sense of -the people as a whole 'will
 welcorne both as the most important con--
 tributions to the art of self government, whieh this eentury has yet seen. ' " I have
 thus quoted at length onza subjeet that may not seem to be germane to our meeting, but
 whieh on a little refleetion we ean all see should rrwost eoneern us. Assuredly all
 who desire their eountry 's good will ae- lmowledge that the writer speaks forth
 words of seientifie truth and soberness. The exposure of sueh existing evils,

 here and now, brings us faee to faee with a biologieal prineiple to whieh we must all bow in attempted improvements or ad- vaneement, that of ehanged environmental relations and resulting modifieation there- from. It ean fairly be elaimed that sei- ence has bettered and is bettering the en- vironment of the workers, while it is unit- ing mankind in ever-widening bonds of unity and eooperation.<Node id="37716"/> Holyoake has well said: ' Cooperation is eonzmereial peate7 eompetition is eommereial war.<Node id="37807"/>' <Node id="37809"/>The rait- roads that make possible seientifie eon- gresses, the steamships that link the seden- tists of eontinents in annual or triennial reunion, the telephones that almost ann;- hilate phonie spaee, the food eanning that makes life agreeable in every elile are a few of the many environmental produets of the past eentury, that link man to man by chains of amity and peaee, and that promote his international well-being.<Node id="38232"/>
 Are the laws of scienee then, as we ordi- narily understand these to be our. sole guide and -rule in life ? This inquiry causes me to recur to Huxley's picture of life already quoted. Are all the moves on the human chess board to be d;etated only boy thoughts of self-interest and self-preservation, or even by thoughts on behalf of our friends and offspring, as Huxley, in his later days, attempted to prove. Some of the vmoves' operated repeatedly in the world 's past have given us as an envir.omnental human outcome, products that we call ; strong lives, ' ' strenuous lives, ' 4 unseruplllous lives, 2 ' useful lives, ' ' instructive lives. ' Buls the greatest type, and the one that we almost unconsciously worship is 'the beau- tiful life.'
 Every organism froln alneeba to man lives by a process that we may eall vorganic mo- lecular equilibrium. ' When the supplies of life energy and food integration exceed the dissipations and disintegration, growth and
 development proeeed. When both are bal- aneed maturity has been attained. When the eonverse to the first holds true, deeay sets in. <Node id="39333"/>Applying this fundamental principle to our eommon human life, the highest human seientifie aspiration might be expressed in the aphorism ssoeiety an organism.'<Node id="39492"/> Such a eondition soeiety is far from having at- tained to. But like all organic bodies, if it is rightly to perform its funetions, and to perpetuate its like, such it should be- eome. At present, even in its highest es- pression, it eonsists of human moleeules that often exhibit atundant energy, that undergo permutations and eombinations, that show affinoties and repulsionsn but that laek some form of energy neeessary to link them into an organie whole, to give them social equilibrillm and stability.<Node id="39998"/> Soeiety has been struggling through millennia to beeome an organismn has been searehing for that energy and that souree of energy that will give it life equilibrium. <Node id="40165"/>At times and in plaees the result seemed to have been aehieved, only again to be impaired, or lost amid a ehaos of diseords, by the dis- rupting ageney of one or of a few un- serupulous souls who have aeted like a disorganizing ferment on the organizing mass.
 Though unfashionable with many to-day, and not least with the followers of seienee, the only mol;ive form of ehuman energy that has stood the test, and that is s-tronger to- day than ever before, is the power, the foree of love, of tompassion, of sympathy, as eommunieated by the greatest soeial lawgivelX the world has seen. The early founders of Christianity were tharged with itn and for three eenturies they shook and finally subdued the Roman empire. We have it in our midst and it lives through all the upheavals eonsequent on human eom- petition, on eommereial war. In our hos- pitals, in our eollege settlements, in our
