2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"premises of another matter of concern, privacy‑by‑design ,"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,privacy‑by‑design
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,scientific principles,"Six principles are that: official statistics must meet the test of practi-cal utility; be developed according to strictly professional considerations, scientific principles and professional ethics; present information on the scientific standards of their sources, methods and procedures; may be generated from all types of sources such as surveys or administrative records and the source chosen with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents; are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes; and the laws, regulations and mea-sures governing them should be public."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,"By employing privacy‑by‑design, privacy issues are addressed at the beginning of the design process, in con‑trast to other approaches that aim at solving privacy issues after software development is complete or leave privacy considerations to legal or regulatory frameworks."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,"The authors also emphasise that the lifecycle of soft‑ware must be considered when deciding on how to best protect privacy, including making plans for deleting data once the software reaches the end of its lifecycle"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,contextual integrity,"Contextual integrity demands that information gathering is kept appropriate to the context and obeys the governing norms of distribu‑tion within it. The key insight is that norms of distribution vary across cultures, historical periods, locales, and other factors. Additionally, contextual integrity requires awareness of not only the specific site of data production but also the relevance of related social institutions (Nissenbaum, 2009)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,discrimination,"When indi‑vidually anonymised data are joined to create profiles, individuals who fit the profile could still experience effects even when they are not identified individually. For example, Graham (2005) discusses how software can be used to assign different categories to different parts of a city based on school performance, house prices, crime rates, etc., which might potentially orchestrate inequalities and discriminate inhab‑itants, even when they are not personally iden‑tified."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,policy solution,"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in member states across the European Union, which is based on a broad understan‑ding of personal data and privacy and will end practices of general consent by default for the production of personal data."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,"By applying blockchain technology to privacy, it becomes possible to encrypt and distribute private data over a large network without requiring a trusted central server."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,We thus reconceive of privacy‑by‑design beyond software to include citizen privacy as a right that should be built into not only the frontend of software design but through relations with citizens as co‑producers in the production of official statistics.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,privacy is processual
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,future,increase their identification with official statistics and possibly advance their role as also users of sta‑tistics. Indeed the latter may well be a collateral effect of co‑producing statistics with citizens in ways that are more in accordance with their experiences and knowledge.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"Some would claim that this represents a “democratisation” of knowledge and the erosion of validated knowledge and expertise about societies. However, as Ruppert et al. (2013) contend, this widening distribu‑tion of data and analysis means that knowledge of societies does not cohere in single authorita‑tive accounts to the same extent that it perhaps did in the recent past. Instead, what consti‑tutes legitimate knowledge and expertise have become major sites of political contention and struggle as revealed in current debates about “alternative facts”."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,gatekeeping,"Proposals that NSIs need to thus defend the qua‑lity and legitimacy of official statistics through gatekeeping practices such as demonstrating their trustworthiness by making their statisti‑cal practices transparent and thus assessable, fact checking competing statistics, and “calling out bad numbers” certainly have a role to play."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen science model,"However, they potentially play into the premise that what is at stake is winning a competition of “facts”. They ignore that what constitutes “pub‐ lic facts” should be open to democratic contes‐ tation and deliberation because they inevitably involve normative judgements about social meaning and choices about which experiential realities matter (Jasanoff &amp; Simmit, 2017)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,co-production,Different modes of co‑production could be adopted that utilise the affordances of digital technologies and poten‑tially produce data that more closely aligns with the experiences and knowledge of citizens.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,new discourses (not new knowledge),"For example, aspects of statistical production that would need to be rethought are those of data standards and quality."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,new discourses (not new knowledge),"While possibly relegating such data to a diffe‑rent status and role, this response provides an opportunity to rethink how statistics are made “official”. That is, it suggests that there is not one mode of production or set of standards through which data can be made official."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,application?,We suggest that this also applies to existing methods that produce data for official statistics but which involve myriad standards and where quality is not singularly defined or measura‑ble.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen trust,"In addition to raising political and ethical issues of privacy, confidentiality and data protection , this calls for rethinkingrelations to citizens in the production of data for statistics if they are to be trusted by citizens."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"We argue that in a time of “ alternativefacts”, what constitutes legitimate knowledge and expertise are major political sites of contention and struggle and requiregoing beyond defending existing practices towards inventing new ones."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"raising political and ethical issues of privacy, confidentiality and data protection"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen trust,the future ofofficial statistics not only depends on inventing new data sources and methods but also mobilising the possibilities ofdigital technologies to establish new relations with citizens

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"data access, data ownership, privacy and ethics, data representativeness, data quality and so on"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,such risks including the enforcement of ethical princi‑ples through instruments of accountability and informed consent; establishing strong compli‑ance controls; developing monitoring systems to track reputational threats; ensuring transpar‑ency and understanding through clear commu‑nication with stakeholders about the use of data and the organisation of dialogues with the pub‑lic; and creating a crisis communication plan
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,solutions,That report summarised a number of strategies to mitigate such risks including the enforcement of ethical princi‑ples through instruments of accountability and informed consent; establishing strong compli‑ance controls; developing monitoring systems to track reputational threats; ensuring transpar‑ency and understanding through clear commu‑nication with stakeholders about the use of data and the organisation of dialogues with the pub‑lic; and creating a crisis communication plan .
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"Similar challenges are encountered when NSIs seek to repurpose administrative data generated by other government depart‑ments, which has introduced not only technical challenges but for some NSIs also raised con‑cerns about how data is shared, joined up and used for purposes other than for what they were originally generated."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,history of statistics,"The history of established methods of generating social and population statistics, such as census questionnaires, surveys and time dia‑ries demonstrates that elaborate practices have been required to secure citizens’ trust in how data is generated and used for official statis‑tics."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,solutions,"Through practices such as focus groups, the pilot testing of questions, and consulta‑tions with civic organisations about issues of consent, data protection, privacy, impartiality and professional standards, NSIs have sought to secure the trust of citizens"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,private corporations,"Big Data , because it is generated not by governments but private corporations such as platform owners, if used for official statistics could undermine these practices and the trust they have relatively well performed."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,another significant issue: the repurposing of Big Data for official statistics constitutes a break and detachment in the relation between NSIs and citizens.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,goals,"between NSIs and citizens to secure data as a collective accomplishment and social good. These relations enable citizens to be relatively active in their identification such as how they translate their knowledge and experiences into responses to questions and, we suggest, in turn contribute to accomplishing trust in and the legitimacy of official statistics."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,agency,These relations enable citizens to be relatively active in their identification such as how they translate their knowledge and experiences into responses to questions
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,agency,"social ownership that stress sharing, collab‑orative, and co‑operative possibilities"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"This proposition was initially put forward in the “Socialising Big Data” project, which involved collaborative workshops with national and international statisticians and led to a proposal for a social framework for Big Data (Ruppert et al., 2015)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,goals,that imagine Big Data as a social and collective rather than private resource. 
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,agency,The approach that we develop in this article builds on this aspira‑tion to develop the concept of “citizen data” as a form of “re‑attachment” and social ownership that establishes new relations with citizens as co‑producers of data for official statistics rather than as ever more distant subjects whose impres‑sions and confidence need to be managed.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"Second, relations that involve more direct engagements with citizens are necessary to address another consequence of detachment when data such as that generated by social media, mobile phones and browsers is repur‑posed: the risk of a widening gap between citizens’ actions, identifications and expe‑riences and how they are categorised, included and excluded in statistics, the interpretation of that data, and citizens’ identifications with the resulting statistics."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,subjective statistics,gap between citizen experiences and official statistics which in turn calls for “subjective statistics”
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,subjective statistics,"a more democratic debate between citizens and data producers and owners to achieve a “more subjective, differ‑entiated understanding of our world” , instead of “technocrats and politicians sitting together and confronting citizens in the end”"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,democratic approach,"democratic debate between citizens and data producers and owners to achieve a “more subjective, differ‑entiated understanding of our world”"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,co-production,co‑production that involve direct relations with citizens in the production of data for making official statistics
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,co-production,with citizens as co‑producers of data for official statistics rather than as ever more distant subjects whose impres‑sions and confidence need to be managed.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"several years of field‑work conducted at NSIs and international sta‑tistical organisations (see Box; see also the working paper by Grommé et al., 2017). This research led to the identification of four prin‑ciples for citizen data that started from key “matters of concern” statisticians have expressed about the future of official statistics"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"The four matters of concern we identified as significant to our concept of citizen data are experimentalism, citizen science, smart sta‑tistics and privacy‑by‑design."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,statistics reference,"We are aware that issues of representation also affect established sta-tistical methods. GDP, Gross Domestic Product, for instance, is one such highly debated official statistic. Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz draws attention to how GDP has come to be ”fetishised” as ”the” indicator of how well a national economy is doing, despite various short-comings (Stiglitz et al., 2009)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,alternative,"Consequently, Fleurbaey (2009) suggests moving ”beyond GDP” and draws attention to other approaches, including recent developments in the analysis of sustainability, happiness and the theory of social choice and fair allocation to the studies of social welfare."

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"Our concept of citizen data comes from several years of ethnographic fieldwork that we conducted at five NSIs and two international statistical organisations, which involved observing conferences and meetings, follow‑ing and analysing publications, and conducting inter‑views and engaging in conversations with statisticians."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"That review led to a collab‑orative workshop with the advisory group and a broader group of statisticians, academic researchers, information designers and facilitators on the development of design principles for the co‑production of an app for citizen data."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,Another reason is that the principles and concept of citizen data also apply to debates within the social sciences concerning research methods that engage with digital technologies and Big Data sources.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"Third, as reflected in our research method which involved workshops with statisticians, a concept of citizen data calls for experimen‑tal engagements not only with citizens but also between social scientists and statisticians."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,embraced experimentation,"inno‑vation laboratories, sandboxes, hackathons and exploratory research projects.5 For statisticians, experiments with new digital technologies and Big Data are methods to develop new ways of thinking, techniques, and skills"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,embraced experimentation,to open scientific and technological expertise to different actors to generate new ways of think‑ing
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,solutions,"The first is through var‑ious forms of participation intended to achieve a degree of democratisation by opening up scien‑tific and technical debates and processes to publics (Marres, 2012). The second is to experi‑ment collaboratively to develop and explore new problem formulations, transcend ingrained styles of reasoning, disrupt existing hierar‑chies and critically examine how knowledge is created (Rabinow &amp; Bennett, 2012)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,solutions,Another form of collaboration involves the co‑production of a “thing” – a tangible end‑product – through which collaborators practically explore and develop shared concepts and issues.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,group making,"As a method, it forces participants to make future modes of working explicit (Muniesa &amp; Linhardt, 2011)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"This is also a principle of what is called in the social sciences and humanities, practice‑based research, which involves an engagement between partici‑pants and the skills, materials, small tasks and everyday labour, in addition to texts and spo‑ken word, that are enrolled in making things (Jungnickel, 2017)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"For example, in an article on a collaboration between academics, farmers and environmenta‑lists, Waterton and Tsouvalis (2015, p. 477) ask how “the politics of nature can be envi‑sioned for an age conscious of the complexity, contingency, and relationality of the world?” "

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,method,"knowledge production. In practice this entails a “care‑full” approach (Grommé, 2015) which entails the exercise of responsibilities for monitoring and documenting who and what are (unavoidably) included and excluded; avoid‑ing ambiguity about the terms of evaluation by making explicit how outcomes are assessed; recognising that failure is likely caused by my‑ riad factors; and, understanding that values are inseparable from facts."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen trust,"Finally, it means being open to how relations between different par‑ticipants in the making of knowledge might be organised differently."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen science model,"Different models of citizen science conceive of citizens as not only research subjects, but as actively involved in the production of data as opposed to traditional methods where they are usually understood as respondents."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen science model,"The European Commission (EC), for example, defines it as the “production of knowledge beyond the scope of professional science, often referred to as lay, local and tra‑ditional knowledge” (European Commission, 2013, p. 5)"

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,history of citizen science,"However, the prac‑tice of engaging people in collecting and sub‑mitting data for scientific purposes goes back at least to the 1960s, though the term itself was not used until the 1990s (ibid.).7"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen science model,"A second version involves citizens not as only observers but co‑producers or producers of scientific studies and data to reflect their own concerns, needs and questions. This version includes local and activist‑oriented approaches referred to as “community based auditing”, “civic science”, “community environmental policing”, “street science”, “popular epidemi‑ology”, “crowd science”, and “Do It Yourself Science” (Kullenberg &amp; Kasperowski 2016, p. 2)"

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,application?,Gabrys &amp; Pritchard (2015) take a similar approach to suggest that the adequacy of an answer depends on how practi‑cal questions are posed.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,recording,What Gabrys &amp; Pritchard draw attention to is that the potential uses or value of data are often not known in advance and that there is value in organising data production and interpretation as practices of searching for potential rather than reiterating and replicating already known objectives or questions through previously established methods.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"While these initiatives conceive of citizen engagement in varying ways, they generally limit it to tasks such as data production, verifica‑tion and classification.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen trust,"But, following from our argument about detachment, we suggest that inclusivity involves the right to make claims and articulate concerns about how environmental, economic and social issues should be categorised and known."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,benefits,"Such a conception could involve citi‑zen engagement in statistical production and lead to statistics that are more representative and inclusive of citizens’ concerns, needs and experiences, as well as their own identifications."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,future,"Eurostat’s Big Data Task Force. The proposals seek to engage with the potential of the proliferation of digital devices and sen‑sors connected to the internet and how the data they generate might be embedded in statistical production systems such that statistics could be produced in “real‑time” and “automatically”.12 In this view, data capturing, analysis and pro‑cessing are envisioned as embedded in activities that generate and simultaneously analyse data. The adoption of such an approach could dra‑matically transform the production system for official statistics and calls for rethinking busi‑ness processes and architectures, laws and regu‑lations, ethics, methodologies, and so on."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen definition,"Being a citizen is understood as a political subjectivity that includes not only the possession of rights but the right to make rights claims such as the right to shape how data is made about them and the populations of which they are being constituted as a part (Ruppert, 2018)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,co-production,"co‑production of smart statistics, which, by definition, involve uncertainty, adaptation and responsiveness to the interactions, interests and demands of different stakeholders. As such, co‑production demands an ethic of care that rec‑ognises and is responsive to the dependence on relations to citizens and their labours to “cre‑ate, hold together and sustain” data (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2012, p. 198)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,co-production,The concept of citizen data we propose thus reconceives of smart statistics as involving new relations to citizens as co‑producers of data production platforms.
