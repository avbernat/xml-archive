This plant had converted former sandy wastes into a floral paradise. But more, our workers had learned the reason for its presence in such quantity, and could picture to themselves the orig- inally scant, but now rapidly multiplying, myriads of 'nitromonas' baeteria that were absorbing and fixing loose atmospherie nitrogenous compounds. They knew that these handed on much of this to the Rhz- zobtum organism of the soil or of the elo- ver tubercles, and that finally the fixed assimilated nitrates were utilized by the clover for its sustenanee.

1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,neither figured nor fully explained; this is very interesting - it's an indication that controls and precise experiment measurement recordings are important to the field,"The first measurement of nocturnal activity by recording apparatus was by Johnson ('26). Relatively heavy animals were used, e.g., forest deer mice, which allowed a simple technique to be employed. This consisted in placing a mouse in a light-weight cage suspended by rubber bands. An indi- cator fastened to the cage traced the animal's movements on a record made by a paper disk turned by clock mechanism. Unfortunately the apparatus, though simple, was neither figured nor fully explained; neither was the tem- perature, which varied seven degrees, nor presumably the humidity, adequately controlled. The work was important, however, in that it recorded nocturnal activity, and gave an insight into the behavior of characteristic forest rodents."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,Introduction; scientists are being cited in these opening sentences along with details of their experimental set-up (setting out the scope of the research question and how has been addressed),"Quite recently Davis ('32, '33) has reported an improved apparatus of the same general type for recording the activity of small mammals. Turning from mammals to the insects, the only other group of animals in which nocturnal activity has been measured by recording apparatus, significant work has been done by Lutz ('32a, b) on three species of Orthoptera."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"nor figured...nor fully described; again, scientist holds a frustration at the lack of experimental details, especially regarding the tools, apparatuses, or machines researchers used","The weight of an insect depressed a counter-balanced treadle, completing an elec- tric circuit through an electromagnet, which in turn moved an inked pen which registered the animal's movements upon a moving drum. Unhappily such an excellent piece of equipment was neither described nor figured in the text, nor were the experimental conditions of the cellar, in which the experi- ments were conducted, fully described. The work, however, is the best that has been done with recording apparatus in measuring nocturnal activity."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,objectively; the first time I've seen objective/objectively show up in a paper and what makes this objective to the scientist is the use of a very well-recorded tool/apparatus ,"Four years ago the writer began construction of a recording apparatus' which would measure objectively the activity of small animals. The circular disk of a phonograph, having a diameter of eleven and three-quarter inches, or No. 10 aluminum pan-covers, were threaded at the exact center so that a brass screw, which was lathed to a blunt point, could be inserted from above and adjusted to any required length. This screw point was centered on a dish-shaped table made by cutting off the end of another brass screwv and 1 I am greatly indebted to F. B. Adamstone, G. Almy, and to F. E. Nelson for aid and criticism in constructing this apparatus."

1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"for field...in the laboratory; this scientist is keenly aware and deciding about what materials, tools, or appartuses best fit this scientific concept of the ""field"" vs. the ""laboratory""",The use of the storage battery is especially desirable for field recording but in the laboratory a transformer was wired to the coil and alternating current used.
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"between two and three seconds; range, time ",I found between two and three seconds to be a desirable contact.
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"a continuous record is formed; the growing importance between reproduciblity, specificity, and continuous measuring thanks to machines/apparatuses","The other end of the primary circuit is always complete as a consequence of the loaded disk touching one, or two adjacent, peripheral contacts. Each minute the circuit is made, and the coil wires of the secondary circuit fire a spark of roughly a quarter to a third of all inch long. These sparking wires burn small dots into a strip of a(lling machine paper which is fastened around a kymograph drum driven 1w a 24 hour Taylor clock-works. Thus a continuous record is formed, each minute giving the position of the contained animal on the disk, and hence its inactiv- ity, and duration and direction of its active periods."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,control; stressing laboratory conditions,"Obviously, in analysis of activity rhythm as complete a control of the immediate environment as possible is necessary to a proper evaluation of the data obtained."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,held practically constant; the notion/concept/idea of a control is being defined here,"This cabinet has been previously described (Park and Keller, '32), but it may be said here that the air tem- l)erature, relative humidity and rate of evaporation within the cabinet were held practically constant, air movements were absent, and when closed the interior was in complete darkness."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml, utilized; there is a need for flexiblity in the apparatus and resilience in order to be a strong functioning and consistent measurement-taker (this builds on our ideas of biases and a control),"In using this chamber with a saturated atmos- phere it became necessary to avoid rusting. To this end brass screw contacts were utilized and the transite plate did not warp, an event which would throw off the distance between the plate and the peripheral contacts."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"artificial environment ; again that need for consistency and flexibility is driving the nature of the apparatus and experiences for different species, also the growing connection between control and analysis of data","resistance, food or a part of the environment cannot be added as the plate would become unbalanced permanently for the experiment; even the accumu- lation of faecal pellets in certain species of insects over twenty-four hours would at times overbalance the disk. Hence an artificial environment must be reckoned with in interpretation of the data,"
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"data, apparatus, laboratory, field ; the distinction between supplies in the field and lab and how it shapes data to create comparisons","Data taken with this apparatus in the laboratory can be supplemented by obtaining data in the field with a compact, duplicate unit, using the storage battery of an automobile, and a clock-works for the transformer, and electric clock respectively."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,further analysis ; it seems like the introduction of this piece is meshed with peer review analyses and there is no methods section. Analysis is also methodological rather than quantitative (based on results),"The unit can be sheltered from falling leaves or strong winds by appropriate screens, and data compiled under normal habitat con- ditions. Further electromagnets drawing pens over the record can be used in place of the sparking coil, in either laboratory or field. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF NOCTURNAL ACTIVITY"
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,categories ; ,"It was shown previously (Park and Keller, '32) that species active at night belonged to at least two categories, viz., their activity apparently was largely controlled by the operative environmental factor complex (Environ- mental Type), or the activity was more or less inherently rhythmic and con- sequently apparently not affected by changes within the normal environmental limits (Inherent Type). Lutz ('32b) also found inherent activity in three more species of insects, using the Lutz recording apparatus mentioned earlier."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"objective ; objectivity shows up again - these eye measurements are seen as impercise and this author wanted to change the methodology to be so an appartus takes the measurement, not the human ","The work done by Park and Keller was subjective to the extent that change in position of marked individuals was measured by eye, and there was the further objection of illuminating the experimental chamber for a few seconds each hour. Although it was felt that the results obtained were sound, an objective check of the problem was necessary. The recording apparatus described in this article was developed therefore, and a part of the data taken with this instrument over the last two years are given at this timie."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,large numbers; the apparatus is molding the experiment before the experimental quesiton has even been asked,"It has been rather difficult to acquire suitable experimental material due to the following limitations: (1) the species must be common enough to be obtained in relatively large numbers from its natural habitat; (2) heavy enough to strongly depress the suspended disk in the experimental cabinet (1 to 2 gms.); (3) flightless, or at least unable to escape from this walled- disk."

1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,internal states ; internal states gets at the idea of traits and adaptation in a subtle way,"Before the writer began studying nocturnal animals, he held a too gen- eralized concept of protoplasmic response to environmental stimuli. The literatures of experimental physiology and development gave innumerable examples of the modifiability of response, and within the confines of ecology, it was obvious that such phenomena as aggregation, hibernation, and others could be controlled by certain techniques. From such a position it was easy to assume that, granting a peculiar genetic matrix, the autecology of any species was a series of responses, called into being by internal states but strictly under the control of the environmental complex."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"experimentally modified ; the purpose of the lab and the experiment is to create specific responses and stimuli, expand modification ",This reversal does not disprove the innate nature of the cycle; rather it shows us that the rhythm can be experimentally modified.
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,habits or instincts; the word the scientist may be looking for is trait,"Neither does it clarify the problem to term such periodic activities habits or instincts. To this end, critical study of the affects of each operating factor and combination of factors should further our knowledge of nocturnal activity."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,the type...they manifest ; again the notion of traits and population dynamics/adaption of traits is strong here even though not explicit,"From this it appears unsafe to draw conclusions as to the cause or nature of population activity or movements within a community, unless at least the characteristic species have been thoroughly studied experi- mentally to determine the type of activity rhythm they manifest. A great amount of autecological work is indicated."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"heredity ; the need of a control and the laboratory spurred by the need to define evolution as a concept, had evolution not been the main ideological framework, would we have labs?","Naturally, the degree of inherent and of environmentally-induced activity is important as bearing upon the ageless problem of heredity and environment. Further, in species which may have inherent rhythms, there lies the further problem of the nature of the control, e.g., whether genetic, hormonal or both."
1935 - Studies in Nocturnal Ecology.xml,"far more exact methods and controlled experiments are needed ; precision and accuracy rising in demand in order to understand the split or relatinship between environment and subject, this idea could have been heighted by the idea of individualism in human capitalist culture","However the question arises to what ex- tent, if any, is this species activity inherent, and to what extent environ- mental. Further, inherent temperature rhythms may be looked for, even in cold-blooded animals. Far more exact methods and controlled experiments are needed to investigate this group of problems."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,quantitative ; ,"In many ecologic studies there is need to express in a quantitative manner the degree to which two different species are associated in nature. Nevertheless, no such measure has up to the present time come into general use by ecologists."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,measures of association ; a historical outline of statistical practices being used in ecology,"Of the measures of association between species previously proposed, the ""coeffi- cient of association"" of Forbes ('07) is useful, though no estimate of its statisti- cal reliability has in the past been em- ployed. The ""coefficient of association"" of Michael ('20) is too complicated for general use. The ""association value"" of Hacker ('21) varies with the total num- ber of associations between all the species in a given locality and therefore is im- practicable for most field studies. Van Deventer ('36) has calculated the per- centage of association between certain species of birds, but his brief statement gives no details of the method of compu- tation. Recently Edmondson ('44) ap- plied the chi-square test as a measure of the deviation from chance expectation of the occurrences together of two given species of rotifers in a series of lakes, but he did not use any measure of the amount of association between the species."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,"the degree to which the association be ; Forbes, to this researcher, makes a greater impact in helping ecologists compare species than other statistical methods","This formula is exactly that proposed by Forbes, except that the symbols are different. A coefficient of association of 1.0 shows that the two species under con- sideration occur together in exactly the number of sample units expected by chance. A coefficient smaller than 1.0 shows that they occur together in fewer samples than would be expected by chance. For example, a coefficient of 0.5 shows that they are found together only half as frequently as expected by chance. Similarly, a coefficient larger than 1.0 indicates that the species being com- pared are associated more frequently than would be expected by chance alone. The coefficient of association therefore gives a readily understandable indication of the degree to which the association be- tween any two species conforms to ex- pectation on the basis of chance."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,deviation from expectation ; this is smart - the researcher redefines or more precisely defines what the coefficient of association is in the context of an ecology system,"Any deviation from expectation may result in a very high or very low value for the coefficient of association. A high coefficient there- fore does not necessarily mean that the two forms are strongly associated, nor does a low coefficient always indicate that the forms are strongly repulsed. A coefficient of 1.0 shows that the two forms were observed to occur together in exactly the number of samples expected by chance, but it does not necessarily indicate that the forms do not tend to be associated. The coefficient of associa- tion is therefore not a measure of the amount of association between species, but only a measure of the amount of the deviation of the number of their occur- rences together from the number ex- pected by chance."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,association index ; author proposing own statistical method that mostly seems like a proportions formula but puts it into the context of ecological systems ,"To provide a simple and direct measure of the amount of association between any given species (A), taken as the basis of comparison, and any other species (B) I here propose the association index. This index is obtained by dividing the number (a) of random samples of a given series in which species A occurs into the number (h) of samples in which species A and B occur together. Therefore: Association index B/A = h/a. The formula for the reciprocal index is: Association index A/B = h/b. For example, if species A should occur on a total of 40 sample plots (a = 40), and if species B should occur together with A on 30 of these plots (t = 30), then the association index of species B with species A (B/A) would be 30/40 = 0.75. This index shows that on three- quarters of the plots on which species A occurred, it was associated with B."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,may differ depending ; researcher trying to generalize ecological relations in a numerical way while giving caution about the value of ecological context,It will be noted that the association in- dex may differ depending on which spe- cies is used as the basis of comparison. Such a difference may point out an im- portant ecologic relation between the two species.
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,coincidence index ; ,"In some ecologic studies it will be de- sirable to use a measure of the amount of association between species that does not change depending on which species is used as a base. Such a measure, here called the coincidence index, has a value intermediate between the reciprocal asso- ciation indices A/B and B/A. Thus: Coincidence index = 2h a+b In the example previously given the coin- cidence index would be (2 X 30)/(30 + 40) = 60/70 = 0.86. The coincidence index therefore is a measure of the amount of association between both the two species compared."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,"chi-square test, data ; researcher is trying to answer the quetstion of how significant are these associations?","No statistical test of the reliability of any of these measures of association has been devised. However, the chi-square test (Snedecor, '40: 16-19) will show whether the combinations of species in the samples of a particular series may possibly be due to chance errors in ran- dom sampling. This test should there- fore always be applied to the data from which any association index, coincidence index, or coefficient of association is derived."

1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,must therefore be due to some factor other than chance errors in random sampling ; chi-square significance determined and calculated in what would be seen as a precise way,"a = 25; b =40; n = 100; coefficient of association = 2.0; association index A/B =0.5; association index B/A = 0.8; coincidence index= 0.62; degree of freedom=1; X2=22.222. of a is 25, b is 40, and n is 100. The number of samples in which A and B are expected to occur together by chance (abin) is 10. The coefficient of associa- tion is accordingly 20/10 or 2.0, which shows that the two species in the example occur together twice as frequently as would be expected by chance. The asso- ciation index of species A with species B (A/B) is 20/40 = 0.5, and of species B with species A (B/A) is 20/25 = 0.8. The coincidence index is (2 X 20)/(25 + 40) = 40/65 = 0.62. In calculating the chi-square devia- tions in our example we used data from two species. The number of degrees of freedom is therefore one. The total chi- square is 22.222 (table I). From a table of the values of chi-square (Fisher, '36, table III; or Snedecor, '40, table 9.1) it is evident that this amount of chi-square with one degree of freedom is far above the one per cent. level of significance. The association of species A and B on the sample plots must therefore be due to some factor other than chance errors in random sampling."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,it is suggested ; interpretations offered by statistical analyses,"that there is a tendency in this situation for species A and B to be rather strongly associated in their distribution. From the difference in association indices, moreover, it is suggested that species A is somewhat more strongly associated with B than species B is with species A."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,"Yates' ""correction"" ; cautions that chi-square does not work with sample sizes lower than 5","The chi-square test is not reliable when the number of expected units in any class falls below five. If possible the expected number in each class should be ten or more. Should the number of samples available for a particular study neverthe- less be few and if there be only a single degree of freedom, Yates' ""correction"" (Snedecor, '40: 168-169) may be applied. It is better, however, in every field study of the amount of association between spe- cies to secure a sufficient number of sam- ples so that no class will contain less than ten expected units."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,care should therefore be taken ; certain conditions make it so that significance or no significance is tested but it does not fit the ecological context (meaning that stats is not absolute),"The magnitude of chi-square varies to some degree with the abundance of the species compared. Two strongly asso- ciated species might occur together on a large number of sample plots and yet, if both were abundant, the deviation from expectation might be slight and chi- square therefore small and not statisti- cally significant. Also, two species that have only a slight tendency toward as- sociation, if both were rare in the sam- ples, might occur together frequently enough to have a large and very signifi- cant chi-square. Care should therefore be taken not to interpret the magnitude of chi-square as indicating the strength of association between the species under consideration. On the other hand, the degree of significance of chi-square may be an indirect but valid measure of association."

1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,must not be expected...statistics will alone solve all problems; cautions against thinking of statistics as a panacea ,"We may thus com- pare the occurrence of a given species with the simultaneous presence of rocks, logs, trees, clumps of bushes, or any other feature of the environment. It must not be expected, however, that the calcula- tion of these statistics will alone solve all the problems of the relationships between organisms and their environments."
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,social behavior ; this section sounds like the discussion section of a paper where the author is assessing the pitfalls of these statistical tools and (what they can't do or omit),"Furthermore, no account has been taken, in these computations, of the possible tendency of the individuals to be associated with one another in pairs, families, or larger social aggrega- tions. The abundance and also the social be- havior of the individuals of any given species obviously affect the frequency with which the form appears in any kind of sample. Therefore the frequency with which any species appears in a given set of samples includes, to some degree, an indication both of its abun-"

No- methods have yet been devised for predicting the values of these measures of association under other pop- ulation densities or under other social groupings than those exhibited by a par- ticular sample series.
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,size of units ; geographical implications not considered,The size of the units from which the samples are obtained influences all these measures of association. This is true because the frequency with which any species appears in a series of samples is dependent not only upon its density and its social tendencies but also upon the size of the area from which the sample is drawn.
1945 - Measures of the Amount of Ecological Association Between Species.xml,"heterogeneous samples...do not provide a sound basis ; limitations of statistics still, highlighting limits of Forbes' example","If the sample plots are of large size, almost all the species in the local biota, except only the rarer ones, will appear on a large proportion of the plots. On sample plots of small size, on the con- trary, even the most abundant species are likely to appear on only a small frac- tion of the plots. For this reason hetero- geneous samples, such as the collections of fish compared by Forbes ('07), do not provide a sound basis for the calculation of the amount of association between species."

It may be that the two forms are mutually attracted to one another or that one form is in some way dependent upon the other. The two species may, however, be associated only because of the presence in their habitat of certain features attractive or essential to both. In such a case the two asso- ciated species may have no relationship at all to one another, other than selection of the same habitat. These statistics at best are a measure only of the actual amount of association between two spe- cies rather than of the amount of attrac- tion between them."
