history,"There have been three stages in the development of the biological sci- ences: first, a period of general work, when Darwin , Agassiz and others amassed and gave their knowledge of such natural phenomena as could be studied with the limited methods at hand"
Darwin,Darwin
Agassiz,Agassiz
history,"next, men specialized in different branches, and gradually built up the biological sciences which we know today"
history,now has begun the third or synthetic stage
future,"Many sciences have been developed to the point where, although the field has not yet been fully covered, contact and cooperation with related sciences are essential to full development"
history,Ecology represents the third phase

ecology,"What, precisely, is the significance of this synthesis?"
ecology,"It means taht the ecologist, though he specializes on animal ecology or plant ecology, must take the broad ecological point of view of his problem."
cooperation,"He secures the cooperation of a meteorologist in order to get accurate data on climate; he calls in a soil specialist to determine the suitability of the differ- ent soils for the different tree species; he asks the assistance of a zoologist in protecting his sowings from damage by rodents; he cooperates with the phytopathologist in overcoming fungous attacks, and so on."
ecology,"There is hardly a science which has not been influenced by the ecological point of view, for ecology is new in name but not in fact; it is superposed on the other sciences, not an offshoot as phytopathology grew out of botany."
society,The workers in this field are gradually recognizing their con- nection with ecology.
institution,Forest Service
epistemology,Foresters have long recognized that information on the relation of the forest to its environment lies at the basis of their practice; they have sought this information under the name of silvics; now such work is beginning to be known as forest ecology.
logics, In the field of sanitation men are endeavoring to change a dirty environment into a clean and therefore healthy one. What is this but ecology?
aesthetics,In the field of sanitation men are endeavoring to change a dirty environment into a clean and therefore healthy one. What is this but ecology? 
application,"During the war one of the army camps was infested with mosquitoes. An ecologist was summoned. He experimented, and found a certain kind of fish, which when introduced into the neighboring ponds destroyed the mosquitoes."
history,"In the field of history, since the time of the great French historian Taine, there has been a growing tendency to correlate events with the influence upon man of his environment."
future,"The foregoing instances will call to your minds many others showing the scope of ecology and its relation to the present trend of science. All the biological sciences demand research which is fundamentally ecological in character. Nobody can doubt that this demand will be even greater in the future. How are we, as a Society, going to respond to this demand? Will we be content to remain zoolgists, botanists, and foresters, with little understand- ing of one another's problems, or will we endeavor to become ecologists in the broad sense of the term? The part we will play in science depends upon our reply. Gentlemen, the future is in our own hands."
