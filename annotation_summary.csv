This plant had converted former sandy wastes into a floral paradise. But more, our workers had learned the reason for its presence in such quantity, and could picture to themselves the orig- inally scant, but now rapidly multiplying, myriads of 'nitromonas' baeteria that were absorbing and fixing loose atmospherie nitrogenous compounds. They knew that these handed on much of this to the Rhz- zobtum organism of the soil or of the elo- ver tubercles, and that finally the fixed assimilated nitrates were utilized by the clover for its sustenanee.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,scientific principles,"Six principles are that: official statistics must meet the test of practi-cal utility; be developed according to strictly professional considerations, scientific principles and professional ethics; present information on the scientific standards of their sources, methods and procedures; may be generated from all types of sources such as surveys or administrative records and the source chosen with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents; are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes; and the laws, regulations and mea-sures governing them should be public."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,"By employing privacyâbyâdesign, privacy issues are addressed at the beginning of the design process, in conâtrast to other approaches that aim at solving privacy issues after software development is complete or leave privacy considerations to legal or regulatory frameworks."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,"The authors also emphasise that the lifecycle of softâware must be considered when deciding on how to best protect privacy, including making plans for deleting data once the software reaches the end of its lifecycle"
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,contextual integrity,"Contextual integrity demands that information gathering is kept appropriate to the context and obeys the governing norms of distribuâtion within it. The key insight is that norms of distribution vary across cultures, historical periods, locales, and other factors. Additionally, contextual integrity requires awareness of not only the specific site of data production but also the relevance of related social institutions (Nissenbaum, 2009)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,discrimination,"When indiâvidually anonymised data are joined to create profiles, individuals who fit the profile could still experience effects even when they are not identified individually. For example, Graham (2005) discusses how software can be used to assign different categories to different parts of a city based on school performance, house prices, crime rates, etc., which might potentially orchestrate inequalities and discriminate inhabâitants, even when they are not personally idenâtified."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,policy solution,"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in member states across the European Union, which is based on a broad understanâding of personal data and privacy and will end practices of general consent by default for the production of personal data."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,"By applying blockchain technology to privacy, it becomes possible to encrypt and distribute private data over a large network without requiring a trusted central server."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,privacy-by-design,We thus reconceive of privacyâbyâdesign beyond software to include citizen privacy as a right that should be built into not only the frontend of software design but through relations with citizens as coâproducers in the production of official statistics.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,future,increase their identification with official statistics and possibly advance their role as also users of staâtistics. Indeed the latter may well be a collateral effect of coâproducing statistics with citizens in ways that are more in accordance with their experiences and knowledge.
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"Some would claim that this represents a âdemocratisationâ of knowledge and the erosion of validated knowledge and expertise about societies. However, as Ruppert et al. (2013) contend, this widening distribuâtion of data and analysis means that knowledge of societies does not cohere in single authoritaâtive accounts to the same extent that it perhaps did in the recent past. Instead, what constiâtutes legitimate knowledge and expertise have become major sites of political contention and struggle as revealed in current debates about âalternative factsâ."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,gatekeeping,"Proposals that NSIs need to thus defend the quaâlity and legitimacy of official statistics through gatekeeping practices such as demonstrating their trustworthiness by making their statistiâcal practices transparent and thus assessable, fact checking competing statistics, and âcalling out bad numbersâ certainly have a role to play."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,citizen science model,"However, they potentially play into the premise that what is at stake is winning a competition of âfactsâ. They ignore that what constitutes âpubâ lic factsâ should be open to democratic contesâ tation and deliberation because they inevitably involve normative judgements about social meaning and choices about which experiential realities matter (Jasanoff &amp; Simmit, 2017)."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,co-production,Different modes of coâproduction could be adopted that utilise the affordances of digital technologies and potenâtially produce data that more closely aligns with the experiences and knowledge of citizens.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,new discourses (not new knowledge),"While possibly relegating such data to a diffeârent status and role, this response provides an opportunity to rethink how statistics are made âofficialâ. That is, it suggests that there is not one mode of production or set of standards through which data can be made official."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,application?,We suggest that this also applies to existing methods that produce data for official statistics but which involve myriad standards and where quality is not singularly defined or measuraâble.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"Similar challenges are encountered when NSIs seek to repurpose administrative data generated by other government departâments, which has introduced not only technical challenges but for some NSIs also raised conâcerns about how data is shared, joined up and used for purposes other than for what they were originally generated."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,history of statistics,"The history of established methods of generating social and population statistics, such as census questionnaires, surveys and time diaâries demonstrates that elaborate practices have been required to secure citizensâ trust in how data is generated and used for official statisâtics."

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,private corporations,"Big Data , because it is generated not by governments but private corporations such as platform owners, if used for official statistics could undermine these practices and the trust they have relatively well performed."
2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,another significant issue: the repurposing of Big Data for official statistics constitutes a break and detachment in the relation between NSIs and citizens.

2018 - Citizen Data and Trust in Official Statistics.xml,political site of contention,"Second, relations that involve more direct engagements with citizens are necessary to address another consequence of detachment when data such as that generated by social media, mobile phones and browsers is repurâposed: the risk of a widening gap between citizensâ actions, identifications and expeâriences and how they are categorised, included and excluded in statistics, the interpretation of that data, and citizensâ identifications with the resulting statistics."
