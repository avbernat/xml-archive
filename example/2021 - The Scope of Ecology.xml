 THE SCOPE OF ECOLOGY'
 BARRINGTON MOORE
 My purpose today is to draw your attention briefly to certain facts and tendencies in the field of ecology.
 All life is controlled by two great forces, heredity and environment, and ecology is the science dealing with the environment. It therefore covers
 practically the whole field of biology, and is related in one way or another to every science which touches life.
 <Node id="1454"/>There have been three stages in the development of the biological sci- ences: first, a period of general work, when <Node id="1570"/>Darwin<Node id="1576"/>, <Node id="1578"/>Agassiz<Node id="1585"/> and others amassed and gave their knowledge of such natural phenomena as could be studied with the limited methods at hand<Node id="1708"/>; <Node id="1710"/>next, men specialized in different branches, and gradually built up the biological sciences which we know today<Node id="1821"/>; and <Node id="1827"/>now has begun the third or synthetic stage<Node id="1869"/>. Since the biological field has been reconnoitered and divided into its logical parts, it becomes possible to see the interrelations and to bring these related parts more closely together. <Node id="2059"/>Many sciences have been developed to the point where, although the field has not yet been fully covered, contact and cooperation with related sciences are essential to full development<Node id="2243"/>.
 <Node id="2246"/>Ecology represents the third phase<Node id="2280"/>. You have but to glance at the list of ecological problems drawn up by <Node id="2352"/>the Committee on Cooperation of the Ecological Society<Node id="2406"/> and appearing in <Node id="2424"/>Science<Node id="2431"/> for January i6, i920. And this list is far from complete. You will see problems requiring work by zoologists, botanists, foresters, geographers, meteorologists, soil chemists, soil physicists, bacteriologists, and geologists, to mention only some of the leading lines.
 <Node id="2702"/>What, precisely, is the significance of this synthesis?<Node id="2757"/> No man can be a highly trained zoologist, botanist, forester, and meteorologist all in one. <Node id="2850"/>It means taht the ecologist, though he specializes on animal ecology or plant ecology, must take the broad ecological point of view of his problem. <Node id="2998"/>He must be able to see all its aspects and how it is related to each of the sciences which can aid in its solution. In this way he will be enabled to carry the problem himself as far as his own field and training permit, and secure the cooperation of workers in related fields for those parts which he is unable alone to cover. For example, a forester is confronted with the reforesting of ten thousand acres of burned-over mountains. He begins by using data

 already accumulated bearing on his problem, but this is not enough. <Node id="3821"/>He secures the cooperation of a meteorologist in order to get accurate data on climate; he calls in a soil specialist to determine the suitability of the differ- ent soils for the different tree species; he asks the assistance of a zoologist in protecting his sowings from damage by rodents; he cooperates with the phytopathologist in overcoming fungous attacks, and so on.<Node id="4194"/>
 <Node id="4196"/>There is hardly a science which has not been influenced by the ecological point of view, for ecology is new in name but not in fact; it is superposed on the other sciences, not an offshoot as phytopathology grew out of botany.<Node id="4422"/>
 Our point of view toward ecology should be determined by consideration of what it is doing in all the fields of biology, whether in its own or under
 some other name. All agricultural research, except breeding, is ecology. To garner successful harvests it is necessary to know the relation of the cultivated plant to its environment. Investigations in alkali and drought resistant crops have added thousands of acres to the farms and homes of the country. <Node id="4880"/>The workers in this field are gradually recognizing their con- nection with ecology.<Node id="4964"/> Should we not endeavor to hasten this recognition?
 In animal industry ecology rendered marked service in its own name when an ecologist in the <Node id="5109"/>Forest Service<Node id="5123"/>, after several years of painstaking investigation, devised a method of restoring depleted grazing lands without the expense of artificial reseeding or the hardship of closing the range against grazing. Many thousands of sheep and cattle were permanently added to our supply through the work of this ecologist.
 <Node id="5435"/>Foresters have long recognized that information on the relation of the forest to its environment lies at the basis of their practice; they have sought this information under the name of silvics; now such work is beginning to be known as forest ecology.<Node id="5687"/>
 Geography, in so far as it is the study of man in relation to his environ- ment, is human ecology.<Node id="5787"/> <Node id="5788"/>In the field of sanitation men are endeavoring to change a dirty environment into a clean and therefore healthy one. What is this but ecology?<Node id="5930"/> <Node id="5931"/>During the war one of the army camps was infested with mosquitoes. An ecologist was summoned. He experimented, and found a certain kind of fish, which when introduced into the neighboring ponds destroyed the mosquitoes.<Node id="6150"/>2
<Node id="6152"/> In the field of history, since the time of the great French historian Taine, there has been a growing tendency to correlate events with the influence upon man of his environment.<Node id="6331"/>
 <Node id="6333"/>The foregoing instances will call to your minds many others showing the scope of ecology and its relation to the present trend of science. All the biological sciences demand research which is fundamentally ecological in character. Nobody can doubt that this demand will be even greater in the future.
 How are we, as a Society, going to respond to this demand? Will we be
 content to remain zoolgists, botanists, and foresters, with little understand-
 ing of one another's problems, or will we endeavor to become ecologists in
 the broad sense of the term? The part we will play in science depends upon our reply. Gentlemen, the future is in our own hands.<Node id="6990"/>
