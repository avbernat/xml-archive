This difference should make extinction a relatively more important process in determining species occurrence in paleorefugia, whereas immigration should be relatively more important in neorefugia. Based on these differences, a series of eight a priori predictions relating to the diversity and distribution patterns for the biota of such sites can be generated: (1) the slope of the species-area relationship, and amount of variance explained by it, should be greater in paleorefugia as compared to neorefugia; (2) the negative relationship between habitat isolation and species richness should be stronger in neorefugia as compared to paleorefugia; (3) species richness should be expected to decrease over time in paleorefugia, but to increase over time in neorefugia; (4) the inverse correlation between site distance and community similarity (distance decay) should be stronger in neorefugia as compared to paleorefugia; (5) neorefugia should be enriched in highly vagile species relative to paleorefugia, whereas paleorefugia should be rich in less vagile species relative to neorefugia; (6) geographic factors should be more important predictors of species occurrence for neorefugia than for paleorefugia; (7) paleorefuge sites should possess more and stronger correlations between community composition and environmental covariables (such as soil chemistry, climate, etc.) as compared to neorefuge sites; and (8) the number of competitive co-equivalents held within a system of neorefugia should be greater then the number held within a series of paleorefugia. The most readily testable predictions (numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5) were evaluated by comparing species-richness and community-composition patterns within two northeastern Iowa refugia: algific talus slopes (paleorefugia) and fens (neorefugia). Results from these tests were consistent with predictions. These results illustrate that colonization history may influence contemporaneous species diversity and community-composition patterns. They also suggest that (1) equilibrium has yet to be achieved in the example systems after 5000-10 000 yr, (2) the ecological-biogeographic debate centered around the mutual exclusivity of vicariance and dispersal is intrinsically flawed, and (3) optimum reserve-design strategies for biodiversity protection within paleorefuge and neorefuge systems will differ.","Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA","Nekola, JC (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Nat Appl Sci, 2420 Nicolet Dr, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA.",106,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2459,"2473",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2459:PANTIO]2.0.CO;2",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Modeling causes of the latitudinal gradient in species richness","ECOLOGY","English","Article","biodiversity; biogeography; competition; latitudinal diversity gradient; macroecology; Rapoport's rule; rescue effect; species diversity; species geographical range; Stevens hypothesis","DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SEA","The latitudinal gradient in species richness, wherein species richness peaks near the equator and declines toward the poles, is a widely recognized phenomenon that holds true for many taxa in all habitat types. Understanding the causative mechanism or mechanisms that generate the latitudinal gradient in species richness (LGSR) has been a major challenge, and the gradient remains unexplained. A different latitudinal trend (named Rapoport's rule), in which the mean size of species geographical ranges tends to decline toward the equator, has been hypothesized by G. C. Stevens to play a key role in generating the LGSR when coupled with a version of the rescue effect, in which local populations toward the fringes of geographical ranges are sustained by immigration. The Stevens hypothesis is now commonly cited as a potential explanation for the LGSR and has provoked numerous empirical studies in macroecology and biogeography. However, important aspects of the hypothesis are not obvious in Stevens's verbal model and may go unrecognized, despite their major implications for empirical work related to large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we present mathematical simulation models that test the logical structure of the Stevens hypothesis, examine effects on global patterns of species richness produced by the mechanisms (Rapoport's rule and the rescue effect) explicitly identified by Stevens, and investigate the additional effect of competition. We find that Rapoport's rule on its own generates an LGSR opposite that of the real world, with species richness peaking at the poles rather than at the equator. The same qualitative result (a reverse LGSR) appears when rescue-effect regions, as described by Stevens, are added to the model. Building upon Stevens's verbal model, we then develop an explicit version of competition and show that competition alone tends to equalize species richness across all latitudes. However, when both Rapoport's rule and competition are included in the model, we find that a qualitatively correct LGSR is produced. Unlike previous hypotheses regarding the LGSR, this version of the model does not rely on a latitudinal gradient in the intensity of competition to produce an LGSR. However, detection of this LGSR depends on the spatial scale at which species richness is sampled, with the LGSR appearing only with regional, not local, sampling. In contrast, when competition is explicitly added to the model with both Rapoport's rule and the rescue effect, an LGSR that is qualitatively consistent with that. of the real world does appear in both local and regional samples. This expanded version of the Stevens hypothesis potentially could explain the real-world LGSR, but all three elements (Rapoport's rule, the rescue effect, and competition) are crucial and must operate sufficiently strongly and in specific ways. The LGSR becomes apparent in the model only when parameter values for Rapoport's rule and the rescue effect are large, possibly unrealistically so, and when all paints on Earth are filled to the competitively defined community species saturation level. These findings highlight the complexity of the hypothesis and the need to consider all three of its components during empirical tests.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Gaines, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",48,18,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2474,"2482",NA,"10.2307/177233",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Although the importance of area and latitude are both well documented, few attempts have been made to integrate their effects in a single model. Most studies have been conducted by superimposing grids on equal-area projection maps and counting the number of species occurring within grid cells (i.e., quadrats). Unfortunately, different grid-based studies use different quadrat sizes, making comparisons tenuous. We developed a hierarchical model to evaluate the degree to which area (based on a nested series of quadrats of five sizes, 1000-25 000 km(2)) affects the latitudinal gradient in species richness. The model allows the relationship between latitude and area to be nonlinear and, in its simple form, evaluates how well species richness can be predicted by the additive influences of latitude and area. The complex model evaluates whether an area x latitude interaction accounts for significant additional variation in species richness above that in the simple model (i.e., assesses the scale dependence of the latitudinal gradient). For bats and marsupials, the simple model included only latitudinal effects and accounted for over half of the variation in species richness of each of the two taxa. The interactive effect was nonsignificant for each taxon, accounting for <0.1% of additional variation in species richness in each case. If other taxa or land masses produce similar relationships, then the form of the latitudinal gradient is relatively invariant with respect to area at 1000-25 000 km(2) scales, and comparisons among studies at this spatial scale are straightforward.","Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Program Ecol & Conservat Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; Texas Tech Univ Museum, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Lyons, SK (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, 1025 E 57th St,402 Culver Hall, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",102,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2483,"2491",NA,"10.2307/177234",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We test three different model implementations of the processes represented by the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations. We use these models to investigate the system dynamics suppressed by the assumptions contained in differential-equation-based models; specifically, we examine the effects of space and demographic stochasticity. The differential equation implementation of the Lotka-Volterra processes assumes that there are enough individuals in the system that the effects of demographic stochasticity can be ignored and that the interactions between individuals always occur as though the system were continually well mixed or spatially random. The model predicts a neutrally stable equilibrium and infinite persistence, regardless of the size of the system. We use a stochastic birth-death (SBD) model to explore the possible effects of demographic stochasticity on the basic Lotka-Volterra model. The results show that, over a wide range of system sizes, the time to extinction is finite and increases linearly with the total size of the system. We introduce a new type of spatially explicit individual-based model called the Heuristic Asynchronous Discrete Event Simulation or HADES. HADES adds an explicit component of space to the SBD version of our process. We compare the system dynamics of the SBD and WADES models over the same system sizes, using the same demographic parameters, thereby partitioning the effects of demographic stochasticity and space. As system sizes are increased, the dynamics of the HADES model with respect to the SBD model, as measured by time to extinction, move from equivalent to less stable to much more stable. We analyze the effects of space on the system dynamics using animation, statistical point process analysis, and predicted system dynamics (spatial effects on the predation rate). We then show that both the destabilizing and stabilizing effects of space with respect to the SBD dynamics can be accounted for by specific nonrandom spatial patterns. We contrast our results with three commonly invoked mechanisms that affect the stability of predator-prey systems. We comment on the strengths and limitations of differential-equation-based models.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Donalson, DD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",56,13,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2492,"2507",NA,"10.2307/177235",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The problem is that the researcher has to choose an adequate group partition level. In addition, cluster analysis techniques will always reveal groups, even if the data set does nor have a clear group structure. This paper offers a method to test statistically for fuzziness of the partitions in cluster analysis of sampling units that can be used with a wide range of data types and clustering methods. The method applies bootstrap resampling. In this, partitions found in bootstrap samples are compared to the observed partition by the similarity of the sampling units that form the groups, The method tests the null hypothesis that the clusters in the bootstrap samples are random samples of their most similar corresponding clusters mapped one-to-one into the observed data. The resulting probability indicates whether the groups in the partition are sharp enough to reappear consistently in resampling. Examples with artificial and vegetational field data show that the lest gives consistent and useful results. Though the method is computationally demanding, its implementation in a C++ program can run very fast on microcomputers.","Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","Pillar, VD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",98,16,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2508,"2516",NA,NA,9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The defining assumption of geographic and demographic closure (i.e., no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration) for the duration of sampling is restrictive and is likely to be violated in many field situations. I evaluated several types of violations of the closure assumption and found that completely random movement in and out of a study area does not introduce bias to estimators from closed-population methods, although it decreases precision. In addition, if capture probabilities vary only with time, the closed-population Lincoln-Petersen estimator is unbiased for the size of the superpopulation when there are only births/immigration or only deaths/emigration. However, for other cases of nonrandom movement, closed-population estimators were biased when movement was Markovian (dependent on the presence/absence of the animal in the previous time period), when an animal was allowed one entry to and one exit from the study area, or when there was trap response or heterogeneity among animals in capture probability. In addition, the probability that an animal is present and available for capture (e.g., breeding propensity) can be estimated using Pollock's robust design only when movement occurs at a broader temporal scale than that of sampling.","USGS Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA","Kendall, WL (corresponding author), USGS Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 11510 Amer Holly Dr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.",253,96,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2517,"2525",NA,"10.2307/177237",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We developed a dynamic programming model to predict patterns that should be detected along the migratory route if Pectoral Sandpipers use a strategy of early arrival at the breeding grounds (time minimization) or arrival at the breeding grounds with excess energy reserves (energy maximization). The predictions were then compared to data collected at stopover sites in the mid-continent of North America and at the breeding grounds in Alaska over a 5-yr period (1992-1996). During spring migration to their Arctic breeding grounds, Pectoral Sandpipers stop periodically to feed. The length-of-stay at such stopovers, for both time minimizers and energy maximizers, was predicted to vary inversely with date and body fat, and to vary directly with invertebrate abundance. We observed that: (1) length-of-stay was negatively correlated with capture date in Missouri and Nebraska, but not in Texas; (2) length-of-stay was not correlated with body fat at any site; and (3) length-of-stay was positively related to invertebrate abundance at the Nebraska and Missouri sites. As the population moves northward in the spring, three regional patterns are diagnostic of migration strategy. Length-of-stay was predicted to be bimodal (energy maximizer) or constant (time minimizer) with respect to latitude, but neither pattern was observed. The migration window, or period of time during which spring migrants occur, was predicted to decrease with increasing latitude for time minimizers, a pattern that was seen for both males and females. Body fat was predicted to increase with latitude for energy maximizers, a pattern that was seen for females but not males. The evidence suggests that males and females differ in their spring migration strategies. Both sexes attempt to arrive in the Arctic as early as possible after ice breakup in the spring. Additionally, females gain significantly higher fat loads than males (up to 60% body fat for females) during migration, and these energy reserves may later enhance female reproductive success. However, females gained large fat loads only during 1993 and 1995, which had above normal spring precipitation along the migration route. We believe that the correlation between female body fat and precipitation reflects an abundance of high-quality stopover habitat during wet springs. This view is supported by model sensitivity analyses showing that the spacing and quality of stopover habitat can strongly influence observed migration patterns. Our results suggest the need to focus additional research on the landscape-level features of the flyway through which shorebirds migrate.","Midcontinent Ecol Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Farmer, AH (corresponding author), Midcontinent Ecol Sci Ctr, 4512 McMurry Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA.",96,31,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2566,"2580",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2566:MARTET]2.0.CO;2",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Nonrandom spatial distributions of these species in relation to edaphic factors could be one mechanism responsible for maintaining this diversity. We examined the prevalence of nonrandom distributions of trees and palms in relation to soil type and topographic position (edaphic biases) over a mesoscale (573 ha) old-growth tropical rain forest (TRF) landscape at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. All trees and palms greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter were measured and identified in 1170 circular 0.01-ha plots centered on an existing 50 x 100 m grid. Topographic position was classified for each plot, and slope and aspect were measured. Soil type data were taken from a previous study (Clark et al. 1998). A total of 5127 trees and palms were identified in 267 species. Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that highly significant edaphic gradients were present, with swamp or highly fertile soils separated from the less fertile, well-drained upland soils. Species composition remained significantly related to topographic position when soil type was controlled for. The main florist ic gradients were still significant when flooded sites were excluded from the analyses. Randomization tests on a weighted preference index were used to examine the relations of individual species to soil types arid, within the dominant soil type, to topographic position. Of the 132 species with N greater than or equal to 5 individuals, 33 showed significant associations with soil type. Within the dominant soil type, 13 of 110 analyzable species were nonrandomly associated with one or more topographic positions. For a variety of seasons, including issues relating to sample size and adequate edaphic characterization of landscapes, we suggest that the similar to 30% of species shown to be edaphically biased in this study is an underestimate of the true degree of edaphically related distributional biases. To evaluate this hypothesis will require mesoscale vegetation sampling combined with quantitative soil analyses at the same scale in a range of tropical rain forests. If edaphic distributional biases are shown to be common, this suggests that edaphically linked processes leading to differential recruitment are similarly common.","Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Bot, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Clark, DB (corresponding author), La Selva Biol Stn, INTERLINK 341,POB 02-5635, Miami, FL 33102 USA.",350,63,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2662,"2675",NA,"10.2307/177248",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To test the hypothesis that habitat modification by seaweed canopies can have direct positive effects on rocky intertidal communities, we quantified habitat amelioration by Ascophyllum nodosum canopies and its consequences on understory organisms in the Gulf of Maine, USA. At the upper and lower elevational borders of the algal canopy, we examined the recruitment, growth, and survivorship of common benthic organisms in canopy removal, canopy control, and shaded canopy removal plots intended to mimic canopy habitat modification. The algal canopy greatly reduced potential physical stresses, particularly at high tidal heights. Maximum daily rock temperatures were 5 degrees-10 degrees C lower and evaporative water loss was an order of magnitude less under the canopy than in canopy removal plots. The response of understory organisms to canopy removal, however, was species specific and somewhat idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in general, at the high intertidal border of the canopy the recruitment, growth, and survival of understory organisms were enhanced by the canopy, whereas at the low intertidal border canopy effects were negative or neutral. Nearly half of the interactions we studied were positive in the high zone. In contrast to positive canopy effects on understory organism recruitment and growth at high tidal heights, consumer pressure was severe under the canopy, particularly at low tidal heights. Green crab predation is likely responsible for limiting understory mussel densities, while grazing by the snail, Littorina littorea, keeps understory substrate clear of algal recruits. The amelioration of harsh physical conditions by algal canopies can have strong direct positive effects in high rocky intertidal communities by enhancing organism recruitment, growth, and survival. These canopy effects, however, may often be offset by increased consumer pressure at low tidal heights. These types of habitat modification effects are likely to be pervasive in many other terrestrial and marine communities exposed to harsh physical conditions.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bertness, MD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",287,166,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2711,"2726",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2711:TTRCOP]2.0.CO;2",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We conducted a field experiment with a suspected trophic cascade. Could an entomopathogenic nematode protect bush lupine by killing root-feeding ghost moth caterpillars? The experiment measured survival of lupine seedlings as a function of density of hatchling ghost moth caterpillars in rhizospheres with or without the entomopathogenic nematode. We modeled lupine survival with a hierarchical family of one-hit dose response models to interpret the results of the experiment. We obtained maximum likelihood estimates of parameters and selected the best-fitting model using the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). The best model fit the data closely, and SIC model selection was consistent with classical likelihood ratio test results of models nested in the one-hit family. A parallel analysis performed upon a logistic family of models yielded results of poorer fit but largely consistent with results of the one-hit analysis. Finally, we compared our model-centered approach with the conventional methods-centered approach of logistic regression in statistical packages. While these packages give correct calculations, the implications of hypothesis tests are ecologically obscure in the absence of the explicit representation of models and their hierarchical relationships. For understanding ecological data, building an explicit statistical model of the process and testing parameters can be more: informative than accepting the implicit model and testing variables in canned statistical packages. The ecological implications were that seedling survival decreased exponentially with increasing densities of root-feeding caterpillars, and the entomopathogenic nematode virtually canceled the negative effect: of this herbivore upon seedling survival. However, the significance to the broader community of this trophic cascade remains to be demonstrated. This cascade is a module or vignette within the greater food web, and additional interactions affect its influence: intraguild predation by nematode predators, apparent competition from other herbivores of lupine (each with its own natural enemies), and even more complicated interactions through competing plant species all come into play. As well, genetic variation of both the lupine and ghost moth caterpillars affects these interactions. Evidence does not support the inference that protection from ghost moth caterpillars by the entomopathogenic nematode is key to the green world of bush lupine.","Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Univ Idaho, Div Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Strong, DR (corresponding author), Bodega Marine Lab, Box 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",74,31,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","DEC",1999,80,"8",NA,NA,NA,2750,"2761",NA,"10.2307/177255",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We linked leaf-level nutrient dynamics with leaf-litter decomposition and explored how the observed patterns were reflected in nutrient cycling at the ecosystem level. Comparisons were made among growth forms (evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees, graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) and between mire types (fens and bogs). A literature review showed that the predominant growth form was more important as a determinant of leaf-level nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) than mire type (fen vs. bog). Evergreens had the highest N and P use efficiency. The growth form differences in NUE were mainly determined by differences in N and P concentrations in mature leaves and not by differences in resorption efficiency from senescing leaves. Sphagnum leaves had lower N and P concentrations than the other growth forms, but because of a lack of data on nutrient resorption efficiency the NUE of these mosses could not be calculated. Nitrogen use efficiency did not differ among fen and bog species, whereas bog species had a higher P use efficiency than fen species. However, a complete evaluation of mire-type or growth-form effects on NUE is only possible when data become available about nutrient resorption from senescing Sphagnum leaves. As leaf-level NUE is negatively correlated with leaf-litter nutrient concentrations, then is a direct link between NUE and litter decomposition rate. Rates of litter decomposition of Sphagnum mosses are lower than in the other growth forms, but there is still much speculation about possible reasons. The role of litter chemistry of Sphagnum mosses (including decay inhibitors and decay-resistant compounds) in decomposition especially warrants further study. The strongly deviating nutritional ecology of Sphagnum mosses clearly distinguishes fens and bogs from other ecosystems. Moreover, N and P concentrations in mature leaves from vascular plant species from fens and bogs are in almost all cases lower and leaf-level N use efficiency is higher than in species from other ecosystems, irrespective of the growth form considered. Both literature data and data from a comparative study on soil nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs in the United States (Maryland), The Netherlands, and Poland showed that nutrient mineralization did not differ clearly between fens and bogs. The comparative study further showed that cellulose decomposition in bogs was lower than in fens and that nutrient mineralization was higher in forested than in herbaceous mires. The occurrence of dominant growth forms was clearly related to soil nutrient-cycling processes, and observed patterns were in agreement with patterns in the components of NUE as found in the literature study. We conclude that a protocol with standardized procedures for measuring various nutrient-cycling process rates that is used by scientists in various wetland types and geographical regions is a useful tool for unravelling large-scale patterns in soil nutrient-cycling processes in wetlands and for linking plant-mediated nutrient dynamics with ecosystem nutrient-cycling processes.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolut Biol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 20137 USA","Aerts, R (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Syst Ecol, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",269,175,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2170,"2181",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2170:PMCONC]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Recently a number of ecologists have attempted to clarify the concepts of strong- and weak-interactors in a community, and to derive techniques for quantifying interaction strengths in the field, using metrics that are consistent, comparable, and of relevance to theoreticians. In this paper we examine potential biases in different empirical approaches to quantifying variation in interaction strengths within and among natural communities. Using both simulated and published data, we explore the behavior of four commonly used or recently proposed empirical measures of the strength of consumer-prey interactions. The type of index used, the experimental protocol, and the underlying model of predator-prey interaction all strongly influence one's perception of both (1) the distribution of interaction strengths among species (e.g., presence of keystone species), and (2) the specific identity of the interactions that appear to be most important. Raw treatment differences tend to emphasize effects on very abundant prey, while the three proportional indices tend to emphasize effects on extremely rare prey. Two of the proportional indices are inherently asymmetric about zero, and they inflate positive or negative effects, respectively. When predators exhibit a saturating functional response, the three proportional measures of per capita effect are biased toward a skewed distribution of interaction strengths dominated by effects on the rarest prey. Predator interference causes the per capita measures to emphasize the effects of rare predators. Estimates of per capita effects are also problematic when (1) the per capita effects are back-calculated from experiments designed to measure collective effects (e.g., predator exclusions), and (2) the collective effect of a predator is constant across a wide range of predator densities, as may be common for keystone predators. Finally, since all of the indices show time-dependent behavior, they are differentially suited fur different experimental protocols (e.g., short-term vs, long-term results, or community initially near vs. far from equilibrium). All the indices explored here have the potential to provide useful, complementary information about ecological impacts of species in natural communities. In this analysis, we attempt to clarify what each index actually measures and the conditions under which each is most revealing.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Berlow, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",172,113,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2206,"2224",NA,"10.2307/176904",19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We propose the application of a determinism test from nonlinear data analysis to describe this variation and to identify a characteristic length scale at which to average spatiotemporal systems. Specifically, we investigate the spatial scale at which to aggregate individuals into densities in a system that combines demographic noise with local density-dependent interactions. The proposed approach is applied to the dynamics of a spatial and individual-based predator-prey model. The selected spatial scale is smaller than the one obtained by a previously proposed method whose similarities and differences we discuss. Two models, the simplest candidates for approximating the dynamics of densities at the selected scale, are examined: a predator-prey system of differential equations that ignores the local nature of the dynamics, and an extension of it that adds demographic noise. These approximations perform poorly, failing to capture broad statistical features of the predator and prey fluctuations. These findings indicate that spatial factors are nonnegligible at the selected intermediate scale of aggregation. Thus, predator-prey systems and other oscillatory ecological systems may display a dynamic regime at an intermediate scale of aggregation in which local interactions are still important. We discuss the type of model needed to approximate population densities in this dynamic regime.","Univ Maryland, Ctr Marine Biotechnol, Inst Biotechnol, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Pascual, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Marine Biotechnol, Inst Biotechnol, 701 E Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",102,20,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2225,"2236",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2225:FITPDS]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

A principal curves ordination will simultaneously estimate the species response curves and locate sites on a single ecological gradient. By means of theoretical argument and simulations, they are shown to be superior to both correspondence analysis and multidimensional scaling, outperforming them in 77% and 72% of simulations, respectively. The species response curves used in the simulations varied from simple Gaussian form with equal maxima and tolerances to complex multimodal curves with varying maxima and tolerances. Simulations were conducted both with and without noise. When species response curves are smooth, and a reasonable initial configuration is provided, principal curve gradient analysis can succeed even when the curves are complex and beta diversity is high. Principal curves can also be adapted for direct gradient analysis in order to relate species composition to environmental variables. Although ordination techniques are used both to uncover ecological gradients and to represent species composition, it is argued that these two aims are distinct. Hence, a single ordination technique cannot generally achieve both objectives simultaneously. However, by superimposing a principal curve on a principal components biplot, joint representation of an ecological gradient and species composition can be achieved. Information from either an indirect or direct principal curve gradient analysis can be added to the biplot, thereby relating environmental variables to species composition and locations of sites on the gradient. Two ecological data sets, comprising abundances of hunting spiders and species of grasses, are analyzed using principal curve gradient analysis. The results are contrasted with previous analyses, using canonical-correspondence analysis and canonical-correlation analysis, and indicate that principal curve gradient analysis can find one-dimensional gradients that explain species composition as well as, or better than, higher dimensional solutions from other techniques. This, in turn, can lead to a more succinct representation and better understanding of ecological systems.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","De'ath, G (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",74,28,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2237,"2253",NA,"10.2307/176906",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Beetle movement pathways were electronically surveyed, and seven pathway metrics were used to quantify movement characteristics. ANOVA and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference post hoc comparisons revealed that both the presence and the grain of spatial heterogeneity influenced how animals moved through landscapes. Intermediate patch sizes elicited the strongest behavioral responses, whereas movements were similar between finely patchy landscapes with small habitat patches and coarsely patchy landscapes with larger habitat patches. These results indicate that organisms may use landscapes that possess different configurations of habitat in similar ways. Predicting how organisms respond to spatial heterogeneity therefore requires an assessment of how organisms use landscapes, in addition to an assessment of the structural characteristics of landscapes, such as grain size.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","McIntyre, NE (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Box 873211, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",60,26,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2261,"2270",NA,"10.2307/176908",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Twenty years of mark-recapture data and six years of laboratory breeding data provided evidence of large differences among six populations in individual growth rates and subsequent reproductive maturation, fecundity, and survival. Weather, diet composition, and prey availability were examined for their effects on individual growth. Two ecotypes were revealed whose distribution coincided with differences in prey availability. Individuals from populations that had continuous access to prey and water across years exhibited fast growth, early maturation, high fecundity, and low adult survival. In contrast, individuals from populations that experienced variable prey availability exhibited slow growth, late maturation, low fecundity, and high adult survival. This growth rate variation was examined in the context of two competing explanations: the maximization and optimization hypotheses. Food availability may be a primary limiting factor to growth and subsequent life history traits, which is consistent with the maximization hypothesis. However, negative phenotypic correlations between growth and survival and between growth and reproduction may indicate an underlying negative genetic correlation, consistent with the trade-off hypothesis. Field studies such as this one are useful for documenting the patterns of life history variation that occur in nature, identifying possible causes of such variation, and generating testable hypotheses for controlled experiments.","Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Bronikowski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 432 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",152,41,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2314,"2325",NA,"10.2307/176912",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Terrestrial arthropod inputs can provide an energy subsidy and increase the abundance of predatory fish, and the ensuing effects potentially can cascade through the food web and ultimately affect primary producers. Nevertheless, the community-based effects of such inputs on stream food web dynamics are still poorly understood. We present experimental evidence that terrestrial arthropod inputs have an indirect but prominent effect on a stream benthic community by altering the intensity of fish predation in the food web. Two key elements of the stream food web, terrestrial arthropod inputs and the presence of predatory fish, were experimentally manipulated by using greenhouse-type covers and enclosures (or exclosures) in a forest stream located in northern Japan. When terrestrial arthropod inputs to the stream were experimentally reduced, fish predation pressure shifted dramatically from terrestrial to aquatic arthropods. The ensuing depletion of aquatic arthropods resulted in a subsequent increase in periphyton biomass. This field experiment revealed that terrestrial arthropod inputs were a primary factor controlling cascading trophic interactions among predatory fish, herbivorous aquatic arthropods, and benthic periphyton. These results provide empirical support for the perspective that transfers of energy and biomass from donor systems are frequently significant for the maintenance of biotic communities in recipient systems.","Hokkaido Univ Forests, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Biodivers Grp, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan; Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan","Nakano, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano Cho, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",390,167,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2435,"2441",NA,NA,7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We studied the effects of a pathogenic water mold, Saprolegnia ferax, on competitive interactions between the Cascades frog Rana cascadae and the Pacific treefrog Hyla regilla. Previous studies have shown that outbreaks of Saprolegnia infection in the Cascade mountains of Oregon, USA, result in high embryonic mortality for Rana but not for Hyla. Thus, we examined how infections of Saprolegnia during amphibian embryonic development could influence larval recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Rana and Hyla. We manipulated the presence of Saprolegnia and embryonic Hyla and Rana in replicated artificial ponds and determined mean survivorship to hatching per pool from daily observations during embryonic development. Pools were then followed throughout larval development, and we recorded mean mass of tadpoles at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis per pool. The presence of Saprolegnia differentially affected larval recruitment of the two species; larval recruitment of Rana was reduced by 46.2% in the presence of Saprolegnia, whereas Hyla survival was not affected. However, larval Rana that survived Saprolegnia infection developed faster and were larger at metamorphosis compared to individuals not exposed to Saprolegnia. In the absence of Saprolegnia, Rana had strong negative effects on the growth, development, and survival of Hyla. However, in the presence of Saprolegnia, the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species was reversed. Saprolegnia may have positive indirect effects on both Hyla and Rana by regulating both intra- and interspecific competition. These results suggest that pathogens can have strong effects on species interactions and may ultimately influence community structure.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kiesecker, JM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",81,18,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","OCT",1999,80,"7",NA,NA,NA,2442,"2448",NA,"10.2307/176924",7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as probes. The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in which we know the true governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06268 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Biomath Grad Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Univ St Andrews, Inst Math, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland","Kendall, BE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Donald Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",288,109,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1999,80,"6",NA,NA,NA,1789,"1805",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1789:WDPCAS]2.0.CO;2",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We discuss a related model, that of basin boundary collisions, that may also produce discontinuous changes in an environmental variable. The alternative model suggests that the underlying structure of the basins themselves may be gradually changed by the changing environmental factor. Consequently, the basin of the chaotic attractor may disappear, because it intersects the alternative basin; hence the term basin boundary collision. The implications of this model can be dramatic, such as sudden and unpredictable extinctions or dramatic and unexpected changes in ecosystem syndromes. Furthermore, where this model applies, ancillary phenomena such as a lag in time of the ecosystem change or the existence of so-called chaotic transients may be important.

We identify the role of fine-scale light heterogeneity in controlling broad-scale community behavior in SORTIE, an empirically derived, stochastic forest simulation model. SORTIE employs a very detailed measure of local light based on a 216-point sample around every tree. We test the importance of this fine-scale description of local light by reformulating SORTIE with less detail in this algorithm. Predicted forests are compared at several scales from total tree biomass (coarse grained) and patterns of forest succession to the local spatial pattern of light availability at the forest floor (fine grained). SORTIE is surprisingly insensitive to the amount of detail used in the calculation of the local resource, light. In all simulations, 48- and 16-point samples accurately reproduce the local light environment and thus predict forest development without appreciable error. A one-point sample of light significantly alters the estimates of the local light environment, but the emergent forest dynamics are insensitive to these alterations. The robustness of the forest model to the altered light environment stems from two very different mechanisms. First, the alterations of the light environment have very short correlation lengths in time and space. This allows fine-scale averaging to occur on the landscape. Second, the functional relationships among light availability, growth rate, and mortality risk in several key species tend to prevent the altered light environment from affecting individual tree performance. These results demonstrate that emergent forest dynamics in SORTIE do nor require detailed local light estimation to capture the interaction between local resource heterogeneity and the functional responses of trees. In addition, we have shown that comparing model predictions at several scales provides a strong methodology to identify relevant detail and understand scaling in this model of a forest.","Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Deutschman, DH (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",51,12,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1999,80,"6",NA,NA,NA,1927,"1943",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1927:EPIAFS]2.0.CO;2",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Such convergence has been hypothesized to result from trade-offs that limit the combination of plant traits for any species. Here we address this issue by testing for biome differences in the slope and intercept of interspecific relationships among leaf traits: longevity, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), leaf diffusive conductance (G(s)), specific leaf area (SLA), and nitrogen (N) status, for more than 100 species in six distinct biomes of the Americas. The six biomes were: alpine tundra-subalpine forest ecotone, cold temperate forest-prairie ecotone, montane cool temperate forest, desert shrubland, subtropical forest, and tropical rain forest. Despite large differences in climate and evolutionary history, in all biomes mass-based leaf N (N-mass), SLA, G(s), and A(max) were positively related to one another and decreased with increasing leaf life span. The relationships between pairs of leaf traits exhibited similar slopes among biomes, suggesting a predictable set of scaling relationships key leaf morphological, chemical, and metabolic traits that are replicated globally among terrestrial ecosystems regardless of biome or vegetation type. However, the intercept (i.e., the overall elevation of regression lines) of relationships between pairs of leaf traits usually differed among biomes. With increasing aridity across sites, species had greater A(max) for a given level of G(s) and lower SLA for any given leaf life span. Using principal components analysis, most variation among species was explained by an axis related to mass-based leaf traits (A(max) N, and SLA) while a second axis reflected climate, G(s), and other area-based leaf traits.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Appl Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; US Forest Serv, Coweeta Hydrol Lab, Otto, NC 28763 USA; Clemson Univ, Baruch Forest Inst, Georgetown, SC 29442 USA; Florida Atlantic Univ, Div Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA; Univ Colorado, Mt Res Stn, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Evolutionary Populat & Organism Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Reich, PB (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",1037,397,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","SEP",1999,80,"6",NA,NA,NA,1955,"1969",NA,"10.2307/176671",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

From a comprehensive analysis of the spatial pattern of a plant population and its environment, we infer scenarios of links between demographic processes, plant spatial patterns, and environmental heterogeneity. The palm tree Borassus aethiopum has easily identifiable demographic stages, a root foraging strategy enabling adults to reach distant nutrient sources, and a marked senescence starting with the onset of reproduction. We analyzed map data for palm individuals tin three different life history stages plus two sexes for adults) and for nutrient-rich patches (clumps of other tree species and termite mounds) in three vegetation types (facies) of a humid savanna of West Africa (Lamto, Ivory Coast). Spatial analyses were based on Diggle's nearest neighbor functions F and G and on Ripley's K function. The main results were as follows: (I)juveniles and seedlings are aggregated, while adults have a random pattern or are more loosely aggregated; (2) all stages except female adults are spatially associated with nutrient-rich patches, but association distances increase with stage in the life cycle; and (3) seedlings are associated with female adults, whereas the association of juveniles at longer distances is not clear-cut. We propose from these results a parsimonious scenario linking spatial pattern and mortality pattern during the life cycle. The initial pattern of seedlings (close to maternal trees) results from low dispersal distance. Later stages (older seedlings and juveniles) are mostly restricted to nutrient-rich patches through nutrient shortage away from these patches (environment-induced mortality) and form dense clumps of immature palms. Competition on nutrient-rich patches then favors the few juveniles that manage to survive farther from these patches (density-dependent mortality). Finally, the last surviving juvenile of a clump suddenly experiences almost no competition with conspecifics, due to the long distance between clumps of juveniles, and owing to its root-foraging ability, it can now recruit to the adult stage, subject only to senescence. Pattern variations among savanna facies are consistent with this scenario.","Ecole Normale Super, UMR 7625, F-75230 Paris 05, France","Barot, S (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, UMR 7625, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",231,71,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1999,80,"6",NA,NA,NA,1987,"2005",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1987:DOASPT]2.0.CO;2",19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator-predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a tradeoff between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA; Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",86,32,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1999,80,"6",NA,NA,NA,2102,"2116",NA,NA,15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We explore the effect of trophic rank upon the strength of the species-area relationship, as measured by z, the slope of a log(species) vs. lo,a(area) plot. We present a simple model for communities closed to immigration, composed of stacked specialist food chains (where each plant species supports a specialist herbivore, which in turn sustains a specialist carnivore, etc.), that predicts z should increase with trophic rank; the model brings out some of the spatial implications of sequential dependencies among species. We discuss empirical examples in which the z values of taxa differing in trophic rank were reported and lament the shortage of well-documented examples in the ecological literature. Several examples fit the expected pattern, but others do not. We outline several additional reasons why z values might increase with trophic rank, even for generalists. If the qualitative assumptions of the model are relaxed, the predicted effect of trophic rank on z should weaken or even be reversed. Trophic rank may not have a systematic effect on the species-area relationship if (1) there are strong top-down interactions leading to prey extinctions; (2) communities are open, with recurrent immigration, particularly at higher trophic ranks; (3) consumers are facultative generalists, able to exist on a wide range of resource species; or (4) systems are far from equilibrium. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate community ecologists to link theoretical and empirical studies of food web structure with analyses of spatial dynamics and landscape ecology, and to encourage empirical studies of the species-area relationship focused on comparisons across taxa varying in trophic rank.","Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; San Francisco State Univ, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA","Holt, RD (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",325,123,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1999,80,"5",NA,NA,NA,1495,"1504",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1495:TRATSA]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

However, such mismatches can also arise due to natural or anthropogenic changes in the: environment, thus providing the data needed to test hypotheses about the ecological effects of local or global environmental change. Here, we present a method that allows this type of comparison to rigorously test for the population-level effects of past and ongoing environmental change in situations where no long-term monitoring data exist. Our approach hinges on the fact that changing environmental conditions will cause population size structure to lag behind that predicted by current demographic rates. We first develop the methods needed to calculate the likelihood of an observed population structure, given different stochastic models of demography responding to environmental changes. We next use simulated data to explore the method's power in the face of estimation errors in current vital rates, environmental noise, and other complications. We conclude that this method holds promise when applied to slowly growing, long-lived species and when model structures are used that allow for realistic time lags in population structure. Researchers using this approach should also be careful to assess the importance of other phenomena (rare catastrophes, recent founding of populations, genetic changes, and density dependence) that may compromise the method's accuracy. Although large data sets are required for the method to be accurate and powerful, the data required will be readily obtainable for abundant and easily sampled species. While most ecological efforts to detect global environmental changes have focused on long-term monitoring, or indicators such as tree rings that are unique to organisms not present in all biomes, this method allows tests for past and ongoing changes in situations where neither past monitoring data nor unique indicator species are available.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Duke Univ, Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol Grp, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Zool, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Doak, DF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",60,37,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1999,80,"5",NA,NA,NA,1537,"1551",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1537:DPLCOO]2.0.CO;2",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The effects of seed mass on performance were specific to species and habitat. For example, in two species, seed mass had a positive effect on emergence. while another showed a negative effect; for most of the species, effects on performance restricted to only one habitat (shaded forest or gap). Similarly, the results for effects of seed mass on the risk of removal were species- and habitat-specific. In the greenhouse, seed mass did not affect either emergence or the speed of emergence under either high or low light conditions. Our results suggest that: (i) seed mass did not have a general effect on emergence success and (ii) the effects of seed mass on seedling emergence are driven by external ecological factors more than by intrinsic effects of seed mass.

The present study examines analogous evolutionary responses to vertical gradients in light availability, through an analysis of patterns of photosynthetic variation among late-successional tropical tree species that differ in adult stature. Larger statured tree species are expected to have higher values for light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) as adults, due to the inevitable gradient in light availability through the canopy. However, we argue that larger statured species should also show a higher A(max), and other sun-plant characteristics, as saplings under relatively uniform low light conditions in the forest understory. This prediction follows if the potential for photosynthetic acclimation is finite, and if developmental processes that determine adult-phase physiology also affect the physiology of sapling leaves. We examined relationships between photosynthetic parameters and tree species' stature using comparative data on 28 late-successional species at Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia. Species chosen for study represent four genera that each include taxa ranging in size from understory treelets to canopy-level trees, thus enabling phylogenetically corrected analyses and stronger inference that observed patterns reflect evolutionary convergence. A,,, of understory saplings, as measured on a leaf area, mass, or nitrogen basis, was positively correlated with asymptotic height (H-max) reached by mature trees of a given species. These relationships were similar in each of the four main study genera, thus supporting the hypothesis of an evolutionary response in photosynthetic characteristics to the vertical gradient in light availability through the canopy. Understory species also commonly exhibited higher leaf-level photosynthetic rates at low light levels than did canopy species within a given genus; however, such crosses in photosynthetic light response curves were only pronounced when photosynthesis was expressed on a leaf mass basis. Midcanopy leaves from adult trees displayed A(max)(area) values similar to leaves from understory saplings of a given species, while A(max)(mass) values for adult trees were lower than those of saplings. This pattern corresponded to lower values for specific leaf area in adult trees than in saplings, a difference that was systematically greater in larger statured species. In sum, a range of both adult tree and sapling physiological parameters, including photosynthetic capacity, light saturation point, and leaf nitrogen content, may be predicted as a function of asymptotic species height. Previous research on vertical gradients in photosynthetic characteristics of forest trees has focused on proximate mechanisms, such as light acclimation responses and nutrient reallocation within individual tree canopies, The present study documents evolved differences among species that also contribute to the overall pattern of photosynthetic variation within forest canopies. Our results suggest that much of the variation in leaf-level physiology among late-successional tropical trees is related to an evolved sun-shade trade-off that corresponds to differences in size among species.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Thomas, SC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Div Ecosyst Sci & Conservat, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",157,52,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1999,80,"5",NA,NA,NA,1607,"1622",NA,NA,16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

One goal of meta-analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists, however, are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse, ecologically based metrics of effect size, with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models, we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the meta-analysis. We discuss factors that can give rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes (e.g., due to differences in experimental protocol, parameter values, or the structure of the models that describe system dynamics) and illustrate this variation using some simple models of plant competition. Variation in time scale will be one of the most common factors affecting a meta-analysis, by introducing heterogeneity in effect sizes. Different metrics will apply to different time scales, and time-series data will be vital in evaluating the appropriateness of different metrics to different collections of studies. We then illustrate the application of ecological models, and associated metrics of effect size, in meta-analysis by discussing and/or synthesizing data on species interactions, mutual interference between consumers, and individual physiology. We also examine the use of metrics when no single, specific model applies to the synthesized studies. These examples illustrate that the diversity of ecological questions demands a diversity of ecologically meaningful metrics of effect size. The successful application of meta-analysis in ecology will benefit by clear and explicit linkages among ecological theory, the questions being addressed, and the metrics used to summarize the available information.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Osenberg, CW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",316,147,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1105,"1117",NA,"10.2307/177058",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In community ecology, these measures of effect size will often be some measure of the strength of interactions between taxa. However, indices of interaction strength vary greatly among both theoretical and empirical studies, and the connection between hypotheses about interaction strength and the metrics that are used to test these hypotheses are often not explicit. We describe criteria for choosing appropriate metrics and methods for comparing them among studies at three stages of designing a meta-analysis to test hypotheses about variation in interaction intensity: (1) the choice of response variable; (2) how effect size is calculated using the response in two treatments; and (3) whether there is a consistent quantitative effect across all taxa and systems studied or only qualitatively similar effects within each taxon-system combination. The consequences of different choices at each of these stages are illustrated with a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between competition/facilitation intensity and productivity in plants. The analysis used a database of 296 cases in 14 studies. The results were unexpected and largely inconsistent with existing theory: competition intensity often significantly declined (rather than increased) with productivity, and facilitation was sometimes restricted to more productive (rather than less productive) sites. However, there was considerable variation in the pattern among response variables and measures of effect size. For example, on average, competitive effects on final biomass and survival decreased with standing crop, but competitive effects on growth rate did not. On the other hand, facilitative interactions were more common at low standing crop for final biomass and growth rate, but more common at high standing crop for survival. Results were more likely to be significant using the log response ratio (In[removal/control]) as the effect size than using the relative competition intensity ([removal - control]/removal), although the trends for these conceptually similar indices did not differ. When all studies were grouped in a single meta-regression of interaction intensity on standing crop to test quantitative similarity among studies, survival showed the dearest negative relationship. However, when the same regressions were done for each unique combination of taxon and site within each study to test for qualitative similarity among studies, the slopes averaged over studies tended to be negative for biomass and growth rate, but not different from zero for survival. These results are subject to a number of caveats because of the limitations of the available data-most notably, the extension of effects of interactions on individual growth or survival to effects on population distribution and abundance or community structure is highly problematic. Nevertheless, the fact that none of the meta-analyses demonstrated a significant positive relationship between competition and standing crop but that we frequently found negative relationships is an important pattern that has not been apparent from qualitative surveys of individual studies, and it demonstrates the potential power of meta-analysis in ecology. We conclude with recommendations to overcome some of the limitations of the currently available data and meta-analytical procedures.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Goldberg, DE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Nat Sci Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",345,194,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1118,"1131",NA,"10.2307/177059",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Meta-analysts will vary in the criteria they use to screen studies and select data within studies, even when addressing exactly the same question. We summarize some of the many decisions that an ecologist must make in deciding what data to include in a synthesis. We then show, using multiple meta-analyses taken from the same literature on stream predation experiments, that meta-analytic conclusions can be colored by selection criteria that are not specifically a function of the relevance of the data. As a consequence, we recommend that meta-analysts perform several meta-analyses using different selection criteria to examine the robustness of reported findings. We also advise ecological meta-analysts to minimize use of selection criteria that are based on judgments of study quality when extracting data from the literature, because of the potential for unconscious bias. The influence of quality criteria on patterns in the data set can then be examined empirically. Our comparisons of mean effect size,for studies included vs. excluded on the basis of quality criteria, provided no evidence that rejected studies were aberrant or more variable than acceptable studies. One result of excluding such studies was a loss of statistical power. We urge ecologists to be more explicit about how data are selected for a meta-analysis, to examine the robustness of the patterns they report, and to conduct meta-analyses to describe as well as to infer.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Englund, G (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",138,45,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1132,"1141",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1132:TIODSC]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Although protocols have been relatively uniform, these experiments have yielded mixed results, implicating nitrogen, phosphorus, silica, iron, and several other elements as factors limiting phytoplankton growth. Meta-analysis has the potential to explain much of this variation by exploring the relationship between the magnitude of limitation and various environmental characteristics. We quantified limitation with a simple metric, Delta r, that estimates the change in the per unit growth rate of phytoplankton directly attributable to addition of a specific nutrient, such as nitrogen, iron, or phosphorus. Preliminary analyses indicated that experiments lasting less than or equal to 1 d exhibited time lags in the numerical response of phytoplankton to nutrient addition, while experiments lasting >7 d confounded nutrient limitation with processes such as increased grazing or depletion of other nutrients. Thus, we restricted the meta-analysis to results from 2-7 d experiments. These analyses showed that phosphorus enrichment usually had little impact on phytoplankton growth, while enrichments of nitrogen and iron increased phytoplankton growth by 0.1-0.3 d(-1). Nutrient limitation due to N, P, and Fe varied significantly among sites. Nitrogen limitation was greatest in nearshore, nutrient-polluted, and temperate environments (where most experiments have been performed), while phosphorus and iron limitation were strongest in open ocean, unpolluted, and tropical ecosystems, or those receiving pollutants with high N:P ratios. Because phosphorus-enrichment studies have been most often performed in relatively polluted coastal waters, the possible role of phosphorus in limiting primary production in unpolluted oceanic systems may have been underestimated. Examining heterogeneity of responses of different systems to experiments is a valuable application of meta-analysis and can facilitate the development of new ecological insights.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Downing, JA (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, 124 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",143,102,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1157,"1167",NA,"10.2307/177063",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Most previous studies that sought to test this trade-off hypothesis compared kinetic parameters of extant strains of bacteria, with mixed results. We employed an experimental approach in which bacterial populations were propagated for many generations under two distinct regimes and their evolutionary responses were monitored. Thirty-six populations of bacteria were allowed to adapt evolutionarily to either abundant (batch culture) or scarce (chemostat culture) resource regimes. The competitive fitness of each derived line, relative to its ancestor, was then measured under both regimes. The trade-off hypothesis predicts that adaptation to either selective regime causes a concomitant loss of fitness under the alternative regime. Overall, our findings failed to support this hypothesis, and several cases contradict it. Only two derived lines showed clear trade-offs, having significantly adapted to the selective regime while becoming significantly less fit in the alternative regime. By contrast, five derived lines significantly improved in the alternative regime even as they adapted to their selective regime. Summing over all 36 derived lines (including those for which the observed fitness changes were nonsignificant under one or both regimes), 15 cases support the trade-off hypothesis, whereas 21 indicate the opposite result. These data therefore refute the necessity, or even general tendency, for evolutionary trade-offs in performance under conditions of resource abundance vs. scarcity. Instead, these data suggest that bacteria are able to adapt to a particular level of resource via multiple evolutionary pathways, which may produce either gains or losses in fitness at some different level of resource.","Michigan State Univ, Ctr Microbial Ecol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Velicer, GJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ctr Microbial Ecol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",62,31,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1168,"1179",NA,"10.2307/177064",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We tested whether spines differentially deterred seed predators foraging on closed and open pine cones. Red Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) were selected as the seed predator because they commonly forage on these cones. We timed crossbills foraging on closed and open pine cones with and without spines. Crossbills did not require more time to remove seeds from closed ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) cones with spines. However, crossbills required significantly more time (18-34%) to remove seeds from open ponderosa pine and Table Mountain pine (P. pungens) cones with spines than from cones whose spines had been removed. Moreover, experiments designed to isolate the effect of spines on the perching and probing behavior of crossbills revealed that spines hindered both activities additively. These experimental results were consistent with our phylogenetic analyses of 21 species of hard pines (subgenus Pinus). Whereas the evolution of changes in the length of time seeds are retained in closed cones and that of changes in the presence of spines appear independent, changes in the length of time seeds are retained in open cones were associated with changes in the presence or development of spines. Therefore, pines that retain seeds in open but not closed cones for extended periods tend to have well-developed spines. This illustrates the complementarity of experimental approaches and explicit phylogenetic models in elucidating ecological processes.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Benkman, CW (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",17,14,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1221,"1229",NA,"10.2307/177069",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Recent theory in evolutionary ecology predicts independent behavioral and life history responses to such constraints, but this theory remains largely untested. In our two experiments on the damselfly Lestes congener we experimentally alter individual's perception of their proximity to a time constraint and ask whether their behavior and life history respond in the directions predicted by theory. We altered larval perception of their position in the season with light regime. In one group, we hatched larvae from winter diapausing eggs in a light regime that mimics a relatively early time in the season. In the other group we hatched larvae in a light regime that mimics a late time in the season. In the late (time constrained) group, larvae would have very little time to complete development and reach a large size so that they could attain their full reproductive potential prior to winter. In the first experiment, the behaviors we assess are activity rate, which is an indicator of foraging effort and willingness to take risks, and cannibalism, which is a component of the mortality risk of foraging. As predicted, time-constrained larvae increased their activity rates, perhaps in an attempt to increase weight gain, and as a result they suffered higher rates of cannibalism. In the second experiment, we measured development rate as the rate of molting and age at maturity. As predicted, time-constrained larvae accelerated development rate and thereby matured at a significantly earlier age and smaller size. Our analysis demonstrates that the behavioral and life history responses of these larvae were independent, in the sense that the life history responses did not result from the behavioral responses.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Rowe, L (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",172,39,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1242,"1252",NA,"10.2307/177071",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We also tested the hypothesis that plant feeding allows omnivorous ''predators'' to survive periods when prey are scarce. In addition, we compared the response of omnivores and strict predators to variation in plants and prey. We found that variation in plant parts (pods and leaves) and prey species (moth eggs and aphids) affected the survival, dispersal, and population size of big-eyed bugs, Geocoris punctipes, in Maryland lima beans. The survival of big-eyed bugs fed moth eggs was high and unaffected by the availability of lima bean pods or leaves as supplemental food. The survival of big-eyed bugs fed aphids, however, was relatively low and dramatically improved by the availability of pods. Big-eyed bugs fed only pods developed normally through the first and second instar, but development was arrested in the third instar. Only bugs fed high quality prey or mixtures of low quality prey and high quality plant food developed beyond the third instar. Plant feeding, especially pod feeding, allowed big-eyed bug nymphs to survive prey-free periods, but plant feeding was not as important for adult survival when prey were unavailable. The dispersal of adult big-eyed bugs from lima bean plants with pods was significantly lower than the dispersal of big-eyed bugs from plants without pods. The presence of aphids on lima bean plants also reduced the dispersal of big-eyed bugs. Unexpectedly, the presence of moth eggs, high quality prey as measured by big-eyed bug survival in previous experiments, did not reduce the dispersal of big-eyed bugs. Populations of big-eyed bugs were larger in plots of beans with pods than in plots of pod-free beans. Furthermore, the most important predictor of the density of big-eyed bugs was the number of pods per plant. Populations of other omnivorous insects (minute pirate bugs, damsel bugs, and ladybird beetles) were also larger in plots of beans with pods than in plots of pod-free beans. However, other omnivores responded to changes in the numbers of flowers per plant and not to changes in the number of pods per plant or potential prey. Conversely, the most important predictor of the density of strict, non-plant-feeding predators was the density of potential prey (herbivores). Our results indicate that omnivory provides ecological flexibility for big-eyed bugs. Feeding at more than one trophic level furnishes big-eyed bugs with complimentary resources that allow these omnivores to survive when resources at one trophic level are of low quality (e.g., aphids) or when resources at one trophic level are totally unavailable (e.g., prey). Furthermore, the dynamics of omnivorous insects such as big-eyed bugs are intimately associated with variation in their host plants and not with changes in the density of their prey. Omnivorous insects appear to track resources at the lowest trophic level at which they feed, in this case plants, and not resources farther up the food chain (e.g., prey).","Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Eubanks, MD (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",145,52,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1253,"1266",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1253:TECOVI]2.0.CO;2",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Adult birds (N = 210) and fledlings (N = 3061) were individually marked, and breeding birds were monitored annually during 1989-1996 to detect banded individuals. Of these 3271 birds, 652 breeding birds were resighted, and 164 of them were sexed through copulatory behavior. Nests were checked annually to monitor breeding performance. Frequencies of return between years were 83.1% for breeding males and 89.5% for breeding females. Frequencies of territory change were 25.6% and 32.8%, respectively. Females >8 yr old rarely changed territories. Dispersing birds departed significantly more from low-quality territories (evaluated through breeding success variables). Breeding failure and mate loss (divorce or death) favored breeding dispersion, both in males and females, but females changed territories more frequently after nest predation. We did not detect effects of resource availability, conspecific breeding density, or mate quality on the frequency of territory change. When all the variables were included into a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), only breeding success, mate loss, and the interaction between the two had significant effects on territory change. Dispersal distance of birds that had changed territory was similar for males and females (median = 302 m). Ninety percent of individuals moved <5 km, and none moved >10 km. Distance moved depended on the bird's age and territory quality, but a GLM model retained only age as a significant variable: older birds (males and females) dispersed shorter distances. These results indicate that breeding territory change and dispersal distance are different individual decisions and are determined by different selective pressures. Dispersal consequences were significant only for females: they tended to change to territories with a lower risk of predation and obtained higher breeding success in the new location. Moreover, individuals in the new territories had higher breeding success than those occupying abandoned territories the same year. Dispersal distances were not correlated with the new territory quality and probability of breeding failure. Black Kites remained close to their former breeding places; individual competitive abilities may determine the final dispersal distance. Short-distance movements in dispersal are probably related to benefits of philopatry (ecological and genetic) and dispersal costs associated with finding a new territory in a saturated population, such as the one studied.","CSIC, Dept Appl Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Seville 41013, Spain","Forero, MG (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Appl Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Avda M Luisa SN, Seville 41013, Spain.",147,54,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1298,"1310",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1298:CACOTC]2.0.CO;2",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We used cohort analysis based on age-specific harvest data to estimate population densities over 20 yr for martens (Martes americana). Marten abundance increased threefold over the study period, probably due to relaxation in harvest intensity at the beginning of the study interval. Changes in rates of population growth by martens were positively correlated with population densities of three species of small mammals recorded over the same time span: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), red squirrels (Tamiasciuris hudsonicus), and flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus). We found no evidence of short-term cycles in marten abundance, nor were there significant cross-correlations at lags greater than 1 with prey population densities. Martens also showed evidence of density-dependent population growth. Such density dependence beyond the demographic effect of variation in prey density was possibly due to agonistic interactions among territory holders. Such mixtures of prey dependence and density dependence often have a stabilizing influence in theoretical models, which could contribute to the observed stability of deer mouse, red squirrel, and marten populations in Algonquin Park. Harvest intensity was negatively related to yearly variation in marten population growth. Mortality due to trapping averaged 37.9% over two decades, with no detectable relationship to changes in marten population density. Hence, harvesting acted as a stochastic external variable that was additive to density-dependent and prey-dependent effects.","Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; Minist Nat Resources, S Cent Sci Unit, Bracebridge, ON P1L 1W9, Canada; Minist Nat Resources, Parry Sound, ON P2A 1S4, Canada","Fryxell, JM (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",64,51,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1311,"1321",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1311:DDPDAP]2.0.CO;2",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

A large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), is a strong determinant of both interannual variation and decadal trends in temperatures and precipitation during winter in northern latitudes, and its recent persistence in one extreme phase may be a substantial component of increases in global temperatures. Hence, we investigated the influences of large-scale climatic variability on plant phenology and ungulate population ecology by incorporating the NAO in statistical analyses of previously published data on: (1) the timing of flowering by plants in Norway, and (2) phenotypic and demographic variation in populations of northern ungulates. We analyzed 137 time series on plant phenology for 13 species of plants in Norway spanning up to 50 yr (44 +/- 0.5 yr, mean +/- 1 se) and 39 time series on phenotypic and demographic traits of 7 species of northern ungulates from 16 populations in North America and northern Europe spanning up to 30 yr(18 +/- 2.0 yr). Plant phenology was significantly related to the NAO in 97 time series (71% of the total), in which dynamics of the NAO explained, on average, between 9% and 28% of the interannual variation in flowering dates. Following increasingly warm, wet winters, most plant species (9 of 13 species) bloomed earlier by an average of 13.0 +/- 0.8 d to 26.4 +/- 1.8 d. (mean +/- 1 se), one-third (4 of 11 species) bloomed longer by 13.4 +/- 1.1 d to 18.8 +/- 1.7 d, and there was an increase in spatial variability in timing of flowering across landscapes by five of six species. Woody plants displayed less sensitivity to climatic variability than did herbaceous species, and early-blooming plants were more strongly influenced by the NAO than were late-blooming plants. Ungulate phenotypic and demographic variables were significantly related to the NAO in 28 time series (72% of the total). Large-scale climatic variability influenced growth, development, fecundity, and demographic trends of all seven species of ungulates studied, and in some populations, the NAO acted together with density dependence. Individuals within mainland populations responded to winter warming with reduced body size and increased fecundity, whereas winter warming in maritime regions led to increased body size but reduced fecundity. Across sex and age classes, between 43% and 70% of the observed range in body mass among years was attributable to the dynamics of the NAG, and within cohorts of female red deer and reindeer, 47-70% of the observed range in fecundity was related to the NAO during the winter preceding cohort birth years. All but two populations of northern ungulates declined following increasingly warmer winters, and the NAO operated, in most instances, in concert with direct density dependence to limit populations. In comparison to the original analyses of these ungulate time series, in 10 of 19 series the NAO explained an equal or greater percentage of variation than that explained by local weather. These observations indicate that large-scale climatic variability has a detectable influence on the ecology of plants and animals in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, and that the responses of plants to winter warming may, surprisingly, be more subtle than the responses of large herbivores.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Post, E (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",453,235,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1322,"1339",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1322:CVPPAN]2.0.CO;2",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We performed a series of simulation experiments to explore whether thresholds in landscape connectivity affect movement attributes (path length, net displacement, and fractal dimension of pathway) within fractal neutral landscapes. We then tested these assumptions by generating fractal landscape patterns in the field across a range of habitat abundances (0%, 20%, 50%, and 80% grass) and patchiness (clumped vs. patchy) and quantified how patch structure affected movement behavior in a generic organism, the common cricket Acheta domestica (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). In the simulation experiment, individuals constrained to move only through adjacent grass cells (neighborhood size = 4 cells) exhibited abrupt thresholds between 50% and 80% grass cover for all movement parameters in clumped fractal landscapes but exhibited a linear decline in movement with decreasing habitat in patchy landscapes. Individuals constrained to move in sand within these same landscapes did not exhibit thresholds in movement with decreasing sand habitat. The exception is for the fractal dimension of pathways (a measure of tortuosity) in which a threshold occurred between 50% and 80% grass (50% and 20% sand) in patchy landscapes. Increasing the scale of movement by allowing individuals to move through unsuitable habitat (neighborhood size = 12 cells) reduced or eliminated any effects of patch structure on movement. Live crickets can traverse both grass and sand, and thus threshold effects in movement behavior were generally not evident in the field experiment. Only small crickets (15-25 mm) exhibited a threshold response in net displacement (straight-line distance traversed) between 50% and 80% grass cover (50% and 20% sand). Crickets did exhibit significant responses to patch structure, however. Crickets moved faster and with less tortuosity in the control (0% grass) and less-vegetated (20% grass) plots than in plots with greater habitat coverage. Crickets used grass cells significantly more (73%) than expected in the 20% patchy fractal microlandscape: crickets were reluctant to leave isolated cells of grass. Grass provided cover, but sand facilitated movement. While experimentation at the landscape scale is generally intractable or impossible, computer simulation and field experiments founded on neutral landscape models permit initial assessment of how disrupting landscape connectivity affects movement behavior.","Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","With, KA (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",143,45,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1340,"1353",NA,"10.2307/177079",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We reconstructed 300 years of succession from limber pine (Pinus flexilis) to Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) in two watersheds recovering from the same fire. More than 1850 live and dead trees were cored and mapped in 25 plots systematically spaced along a topographic gradient. We used tree ring analysis to reconstruct dates of tree establishment and death. Relative species abundances and basal areas were charted at 20-yr intervals, and three measures of ecological similarity were also used to capture different elements of change:simple Euclidean distance, Euclidean distance in ordination space, and Horn's C-H similarity index. Successional rates for mesic lower slopes and north aspects were roughly twice those on south-facing side slopes. Rates were positively correlated with soil P, N, Fe, organic matter, and Parker's topographic moisture index, and negatively correlated with solar radiation and surface rock cover. Higher rates on mesic plots were primarily the result of heavy overstory mortality of pioneer limber pines similar to 200 yr postfire, coupled with higher recruitment of spruce and fir 200-300 yr postfire. On mesic sites, successional rates peaked during this thinning phase of limber pine, but rates were stable or slowly increasing 300 yr postfire on xeric sites. Previous studies have shown that Clark's Nutcracker catalyzes early succession by caching limber pine seeds in extensive burns, many of which germinate to form multitrunk pines. Limber pines, in turn, may act as nurse trees for spruce and fr. However, we reconstructed past spatial patterns of trees and found that limber pine mortality in midsuccession was strongly related to its clumped pattern of establishment and tendency to attract spruce and fir. Solitary pines with no spruce and fir neighbors within a 2 m radius had a >80% chance of survival, 1893-1993. In contrast, pines within clumps of six or more trees and surrounded by many spruce and fir trees had only 10-20% chance of survival, 1893-1993. The multitrunk growth form of limber pines may be selectively advantageous on harsh sites, including early postfire environments, but our results suggest that this same growth form may be disadvantageous on mesic sites with heavy spruce and fir competition during mid- to late-successional stages. We confirmed the equilibrium prediction that succession is more rapid on mesic sites, but even in this very simple system, demographic mechanisms of succession were relatively complex.","Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Donnegan, JA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Box 260, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",85,43,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1370,"1384",NA,"10.2307/177081",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To estimate the importance of indirect effects, we analyzed the population dynamics of nine zooplankton species or species groups in a lake subjected to experimental manipulations of the fish community. The manipulations included additions and removals of planktivorous and piscivorous fish over a period of seven years, thereby producing changes in planktivory rates on the zooplankton community. Applying autoregressive models to time-series data, collected during weekly samples, we estimated the direct interaction strengths between species, thereby constructing a quantitative interaction web for the zooplankton community. We then used this interaction web to explore the roles of direct and indirect interactions between species in determining the long-term changes in zooplankton biomasses that were observed over the course of the experimental manipulations. The analysis identified Daphnia pulex as a keystone species. This large herbivore had strong direct interactions with other zooplankton species and was strongly affected by changes in planktivory. Consequently, changes in the biomasses of other zooplankton species during the planktivory manipulations were influenced strongly by indirect interactions acting through changes in D. pulex biomass. In addition, we used the analysis to ask whether information about the response of species to planktivory manipulations could be used to anticipate species' responses to other types of perturbation. If the direct effects of a novel perturbation on each species in a community were known, then the interaction web would help to anticipate how a novel perturbation will affect each species via direct and indirect effects through the community.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Univ Idaho, Div Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA","Ives, AR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",86,59,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1999,80,"4",NA,NA,NA,1405,"1421",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)080[1405:CIWAZR]2.0.CO;2",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

On the other hand, most insectivorous plants depend on free-moving, live insects as pollen vectors for sexual reproduction. In Pinguicula vallisneriifolia Webb, the spatial and temporal coincidence between flowers and the first distal leaves presents a potential conflict between the plant-pollinator and plant-prey systems. To examine this possibility, I combined an extensive regional survey to identify the pollinator assemblages and to analyze prey capture with a local intensive study to investigate the mechanisms of interference between the two systems. I analyzed the possible conflicting functions of pollination vs. insectivory under contrasting abiotic scenarios. Field observations and experiments confirmed the pollinator role of small flower visitors and the interference between the plant-pollinator and plant-prey systems. The degree of this interference is determined by the size and foraging behavior of pollinators, given that only small pollinators become entangled on leaves. Plants in bloom had a greater probability of capturing thrips than did plants without flowers. Because P. vallisneriifolia is pollen limited, the capture of small pollinators depleted the availability of the resource that limited plant reproduction. The pollinator-prey conflict is, however, environment specific, because the shadiness of the microsite where the plant grows determines both the distribution and abundance of different-sized insect species and the retention capacity of the mucilage. The present results indicate that plant-pollinator and plant-prey interactions can be strongly determined by species-specific ecophysiological responses of flying insects and sessile plants to abiotic characteristics of the environment. The physical environment affects the outcomes of plant-animal interactions and, ultimately, the balance between mutualistic and antagonistic systems.","Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, Unidad Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Zamora, R (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, Unidad Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",45,39,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,786,"795",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0786:COOITP]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.","Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gomez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",131,61,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,796,"805",NA,"10.2307/177018",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Microenvironmental variables-including light levels, litter depth, soil exposure, soil moisture, and soil organic matter content-were quantified in experimental plots where the fern understory was undisturbed, partially removed or completely removed and were related to natural recruitment and 1st-yr survival of Acer rubrum, Betula lenta, B, alleghaniensis, Fraxinus americana, Pinus strobus, and Quercus rubra. We conducted a series of three field emergence experiments to test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of fern interference with seedling emergence. The fern understory reduced light levels from 3.4% of full sun to 1.1% of full sun beneath its canopy. Soil exposure was lower and litter depth was greater under fern cover, whereas soil moisture and soil organic-matter content were not affected by fern cover. The understory filter differentially influenced tree-seedling emergence. Fern cover decreased emergence of Betula, Finns, and Quercus but did not affect the emergence of Acer or Fraxinus. The mechanism of fern interference was species-specific: Betula emergence was reduced primarily by low levels of soil exposure, Pinus emergence appeared to be related to reduced light levels, and Quercus suffered higher levels of seed predation under fern cover. The presence of understory fern cover also differentially influenced Ist-yr survival of natural tree-seedling recruitment. Although seedling survivorship during the first growing season was related to seed size, seedling survivorship below ferns by the end of the Ist yr was independent of seed size. Selectivity of the fern filter is caused by differential response of tree-seedling species to the presence of understory cover and was generally not affected by the species identity of the understory plant. The selectivity of the understory filter can influence the density and species composition of the seedling bank below its canopy and can determine patterns of seedling spatial distribution at the stand level.","Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","George, LO (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, 16 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",239,94,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,833,"845",NA,"10.2307/177021",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In New England deciduous forests we tested the hypothesis that the understory stratum is a selective filter that differentially influences growth and survival of tree-seedling species by comparing performance of Acer rubrum, Betula alleghaniensis, and Quercus rubra seedlings in plots where the fern understory was undisturbed, partially removed, or completely removed. We related seedling growth and survival to microenvironmental characteristics of experimental plots in order to further explore mechanisms responsible for the filtering capacity of the fern understory. The presence of a fern understory reduced growth and survival of all seedling species, but the magnitude of the effect differed among species. Mortality resulting from resource limitation in Quercus below the fern understory was balanced by mortality resulting from insect herbivory in fern-free areas. Relative biomass growth rates of all species were negatively influenced by the presence of fern cover, whereas relative height growth rates of Acer and Quercus were uniformly low and insensitive to the presence of fern cover. Growth and survival rates indicate that only Quercus seedlings can emerge from the fern stratum in the absence of understory or overstory canopy disturbance. A trade-off between persistence in low light and maximum growth in understory light levels was observed among species. The relative growth rate of Betula in terms of biomass and height was more responsive to light levels than were relative growth rates of Acer or Quercus, and the growth rate of Betula was higher than that of Acer and Quercus in all light levels. However, survival of Betula below the fern stratum was lower than survival of Acer and Quercus. The fern understory has the capacity to selectively filter tree seedlings as they grow up through it because seedling species respond differentially to the presence of fern cover. The selective filtering of tree seedlings by the fern understory results in a seedling spatial structure that reflects the spatial heterogeneity of the fern stratum. The seedling pool below the fern stratum has a lower seedling density and different species composition and size structure than the seedling pool in fern-free areas.","Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","George, LO (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, 16 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",164,62,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,846,"856",NA,"10.2307/177022",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In 1995 we mapped the location of both earthworm surface casts and plants in each of 16 1.2-m(2) plots in a species-rich calcareous grassland in northwestern Switzerland. Eight plots have been maintained under current ambient CO2 concentrations (350 mu L CO2/ L), and eight have been maintained at elevated CO2 (600 mu L CO2/L) since March 1994. in addition, total ramet production of each species, as a measure of performance, and cumulative cast production at each location (cell) were recorded at peak community biomass in 1995. Plant species within functional groups (graminoids, non-legume forbs, and legumes) differed markedly in their degree of association with casts; however, after two growing seasons elevated CO2 had no effect on plant species or functional group associations with casts. No statistically significant relationship could be demonstrated between plant-species response (i.e., ramet production) to elevated CO2 and the degree of association with casts within any of the functional groups. However, a positive relationship was observed between the mean response of graminoid species to elevated CO2 (measured as the percentage change in mean total ramet production of graminoid species, relative to mean total ramet production at ambient CO2) and their mean degree of association (%) with surface casts at ambient CO2. Thus, graminoid species more frequently associated with casts (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum and Carer caryophyllea) produced more ramets per square meter at elevated CO2 than those less frequently associated with casts (e.g., Agrostis tenuis and Danthonia decumbens). These results, along with the strong and significant positive correlations observed between ramet production and associated cumulative cast mass across CO2 treatments for most plant species in all functional groups demonstrate: (1) that plant species differ significantly in their degree of association with nutrient-rich earthworm surface casts, regardless of the relative abundance of plant species in the community; (2) that graminoid species that are more highly associated with casts may respond more strongly to rising CO2 than those less highly associated with casts; and (3) that nutrient-rich earthworm casts stimulate the growth (ramet production) of most plant species in these grassland communities, even at current levels of atmospheric CO2. The data further suggest that these species-specific relationships between plants and casts have helped define the current structure of these highly diverse grassland communities and will likely influence their future structure as global CO2 levels continue to rise.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Zaller, JG (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Dept Rangeland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",30,28,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,873,"881",NA,NA,9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In general, observed experimental responses were fairly consistent with predictions. The largest discrepancy occurred when sods were transplanted from high- to low-salinity sites and herbivores selectively consumed a particularly palatable plant species in the transplanted sods. Individual plot responses to some treatments were predicted more accurately than others. Individual fertilized plot responses were not consistent with predictions (P > 0.05), nor were fenced plots (herbivore exclosures; R-2 = 0.15) compared to unfenced plots (R-2 = 0.53). For the remaining treatments, predictions reasonably matched responses (R-2 = 0.63). We constructed an SEM for the experimental data; it explained 60% of the variance in species density and showed that fencing and fertilization led to decreases in species density that were not predicted from treatment effects on community biomass or observed disturbance levels. These treatments may have affected the ratio of live to dead biomass, and competitive exclusion likely decreased species density in fenced and fertilized plots.

In this study, interspecific and age-specific variation in the water relations and photosynthetic properties of these lupines were assessed to determine their physiological capacity to colonize these volcanic habitats. Comparative water-relations studies showed that seasonal and diurnal trends in plant water balance were similar between species and age classes. Stomatal conductance and xylem pressure potential of seedlings and adults were closely coupled with soil water potential and leaf-to-air vapor-pressure gradients. Relatively high osmotic potentials were linked with high leaf water contents and cell-wall elasticity. Collectively, these water-relations properties are indicative of mesophytic, herbaceous species with leaf tissues sensitive to soil and atmospheric water deficits. The photosynthetic capacity of L. lepidus was higher over a wider range of environmental conditions than that of L. latifolius. L. lepidus had a higher light saturation point and was able to acclimate photosynthetically to higher temperatures, relative to L. latifolius. The photosynthetic activity of L. lepidus seedlings was significantly greater at higher light and temperature regimes compared to seedlings of L. latifolius. Differing photosynthetic responses to temperature and light help explain the contrasting demographic patterns of these lupines and the relative dominance of L. lepidus in early successional habitats on Mount St. Helens, The physiological capacity to respond to extreme temperatures and periodic water deficits also appears to be an important determinant of the natural distribution patterns of these two species in the Pacific Northwest: L, lepidus occupies windy, exposed alpine habitats, whereas L. latifolius is common within subalpine meadows and coniferous treeline communities.","Univ Washington, Dept Bot, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Braatne, JH (corresponding author), 7703 39th Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",22,18,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,891,"907",NA,NA,17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Only under high mortality and low energy reserves in a uniform landscape did absolutely straight-line search perform better than any random walk. With low mortality risks and high energy reserves, exhaustive systematic search was superior to the best correlated random walk; an increase in the perceptual range of the searcher (i.e., patch detectability) also favored exhaustive search over relatively straight random walks. For all conditions examined, the average distance rule, a hybrid search rule incorporating both straight-line and systematic search, was best. Overall, however, our results suggest that a simple and effective search rule for many landscape-explicit models would involve straight or nearly straight movements.","Indiana State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA","Zollner, PA (corresponding author), Indiana State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",364,90,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","APR",1999,80,"3",NA,NA,NA,1019,"1030",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1019:SSFLLI]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Multilocus molecular data sets have proved to be particularly useful for hybrid identification and genealogical reconstruction. One widely recognized limitation to this approach is that hybrid and parental genotypic classes often differ minimally in terms of expected marker numbers, and an extremely large number of molecular markers are required to distinguish between them. A more fundamental difficulty, and the focus of this study, concerns the potential for selection to bias marker numbers in hybrids, thus leading to faulty genealogical assignments. In this paper, we compare observed and expected marker numbers in 170 hybrids of known pedigree between two wild sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris. All 170 hybrid plants had fewer H. petiolaris markers than the expected means. In fact, with the exception of two individuals, marker numbers were more consistent with pedigrees involving three to seven backcrossed generations, rather than the two generations of backcrossing actually employed. Although the implications of these data for genealogical reconstruction are discouraging, it is the actual genetic constitution of hybrids, not the pedigree, that is most predictive of their characteristics or behavior. Thus, we suggest that hybrids be classified either in terms of genetic relatedness or in terms of the admixture of parental-species genes they carry. Both represent simple approaches for generating biologically cohesive categories for ecological or comparative studies.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Bot, Austin, TX 78713 USA","Rieseberg, LH (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",41,8,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1999,80,"2",NA,NA,NA,361,"370",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0361:HCIFGM]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Evaluation of these assumptions suggests that operation of the hybrid bridge hypothesis is relatively uncommon. In addition, the hypothesis has not been well integrated into existing theoretical and empirical work on the evolution of host range in herbivorous insects. Proper evaluation of the hypothesis will require information on the effect of plant hybridization on both insect preference and insect performance.

Studies in the wild and in gardens with synthetic crosses showed that hybrid eucalypts supported the greatest species richness and abundances of insect and fungal taxa. In an updated review of 152 case studies of taxa associated with diverse hybridizing systems, there were 43 (28%) cases of hybrids being more susceptible than their parent species, 7 (5%) resistant, 35 (23%) additive, 35 (23%) dominant, and 32 (21%) showed no response to hybridization. Thus, most taxa respond to hybrids in ways that result in equal or greater abundance, and hybrids tend to accumulate the taxa of their parent species. These studies suggest that genetic-based plant traits affect the distribution of many species and that the variation in hybrids can be used as tools to examine the genetic components of community structure and biodiversity. Several patterns have emerged thus far. (1) Genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., F(1)'s vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species. (2) As a reflection of this genetic variation, herbivores are more likely to differentiate between hybrid classes than they are to differentiate between pure plant species. (3) The communities associated with different hybrid classes can differ from one another as well as from their parental species. (4) Generalist and specialist herbivores predictably vary in their responses to hybrids. (5) Plant hybrid zones may represent essential habitat for some arthropod species. (6) Even nesting birds respond to hybridizing plants. (7) Including multiple trophic levels and taxa from microbes to vertebrates, susceptible hybrid genotypes support greater biodiversity than resistant genotypes. (8) The effects of hybridization on common or keystone species can either positively or negatively affect biodiversity. The indirect impacts of hybridization on biodiversity may exceed the direct impacts and may result in apparent herbivore resistance or susceptibility at the community level. (9) Although hybrids are often maligned, exotic or problem hybrids generally result from human disturbances, whereas native hybrids are part of natural ecosystems and should be conserved. Three predictions are made: (1) Intermediate genetic differences between the parental species will result in the greatest genetic variation in the hybrid zone, which in turn will have a positive effect on biodiversity. (2) Bidirectional introgression enhances species richness on hybrids, whereas F(1) sterility and unidirectional introgression limit the accumulation of species on hybrids. (3) Although susceptible hybrids are likely to support the greatest biodiversity, the impacts of hybridization on keystone species will be crucial in determining the overall effect.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; Agr & Agri Food Canada, Lethbridge, AB T1J 4B1, Canada; Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, CRC Sustainable Prod Forestry, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Queensland Forest Res Inst, Gympie, Qld 4570, Australia","Whitham, TG (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",170,52,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","MAR",1999,80,"2",NA,NA,NA,416,"428",NA,NA,13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

It is thus often unclear whether a plant's value as a food or its value as a safe shelter has played a larger role in selecting for specialization. Decorator crabs offer a novel opportunity to investigate the relative effects of diet vs. natural enemies in selecting for specialization because these crabs place plant shelter on their backs as camouflage but need not use these plants as food, thus decoupling the plant's value as a food from its value as a shelter. In this study, we show that juveniles of the decorator crab Libinia nubia selectively decorate with the chemically defended brown alga Dictyota menstrualis but treat this plant as a low-preference food. Common omnivorous fishes that are potential predators of Libinia avoid consuming Dictyota due to the alga's potent chemical defenses. In the field, juvenile crabs decorated with Dictyota experience significantly less predation than crabs decorated with an alga that is not chemically noxious to local fishes, and the Dictyota metabolite that most strongly deters feeding by fishes is the specific metabolite that determines decoration choice by this crab. Thus, by behaviorally sequestering defenses from this chemically noxious plant, these small crabs reduce their susceptibility to predation. In the presence of predators, juvenile crabs reduce their rate of feeding, but not of decorating, suggesting that antipredator behavior such as decorating takes precedence over feeding. In addition, only juvenile crabs that are of a size that can be consumed by local fishes decorate at all. Adult crabs that have carapace widths exceeding the gape size of co-occurring fishes do not decorate in either the field or the laboratory. Apparently predation, rather than diet selection, drives decoration specialization in Libinia, highlighting how indirect effects of plant secondary chemistry can impact herbivore behavior, ecology, and evolution.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Stachowicz, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, 1084 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA.",111,76,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1999,80,"2",NA,NA,NA,495,"509",NA,"10.2307/176628",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Model performance is optimized to satisfy, simultaneously, each component of a vector of assessment criteria (model outputs), rather than the usual procedure of optimizing performance with respect to a single criterion. Pareto Optimality is used to define the vector optimization. The Pareto Optimal Set reveals which combinations of assessment criteria the model can satisfy simultaneously. Binary interval error measures, which classify whether a parameterization result is within an acceptable range of values, are defined for each criterion. Their use masks small differences in the performance of different parameterizations. allowing the Pareto Optimal Set to reveal conflicts in ability to achieve simultaneously different collections of criteria. POMAC improves the researcher's ability to detect deficiencies and locate their sources. It is more stringent and informative than traditional model assessment procedures because it uses multiple criteria without weighting and aggregating them. The Pareto Optimal Set reveals the presence of deficiencies through the model's inability to satisfy all the criteria simultaneously. POMAC then guides the researcher in locating deficiencies in: inadequate selection of component ecological hypotheses underlying the model, inadequate mathematical representations of these hypotheses, inadequate parameterization, poor selection and formulation of the assessment criteria, or combinations of these. In an example, POMAC is applied to the spatially explicit canopy competition model WHORL using ten assessment criteria. Each criterion was selected to provide information on different aspects of WHORL's functioning: three stand height distribution criteria, three crown morphology criteria, and four criteria focusing on stand competition's characteristic differentiation of growth rates. The Pareto Optimal Set was generated using simulated evolution optimization. POMAC revealed deficiencies in both the model structure and its assessment criteria, leading to an improved model and better understanding of its effective domain.","Univ Washington, Quantitat Ecol & Resource Management Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Reynolds, JH (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Box 35-4322, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",49,6,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","MAR",1999,80,"2",NA,NA,NA,538,"553",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0538:MCAOEP]2.0.CO;2",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

A previously proposed, theoretical model of intraspecific variation in optimal timing of nest departure in alcids predicts that: (1) variation in growth rate among chicks will result in negative correlations between departure mass and departure age, and (2) in the absence of seasonal declines in chick growth rates (such declines are consistent features of alcid biology), variation in timing of hatching among chicks will cause both mass and age at departure to decline with hatching date, We tested these predictions for Thick-billed Murres and Razorbills, two alcids that employ a unique development strategy. To control for the confounding effects of seasonal variation in growth rates, caused at least in part by variation in the characteristics of adults breeding at different times, we switched eggs at random among breeding pairs in each of two years for both study species. Contrary to prediction 1, there were no significant negative correlations between departure mass and departure age, and in fact, there was one significant positive relationship. Contrary to prediction 2, departure mass did not decline with hatching date; in agreement with prediction 2, departure age often declined with date. Our results suggest that, for Thick-billed Murres and Razorbills: (1) variation in growth rate probably does not influence timing of nest departure in the manner outlined in the model, and (2) it is unlikely that variation in hatching date affects the departure decision in the manner predicted by the model. Based on our experimental results, and previously reported observations of Thick billed Murres, we develop alternative hypotheses, emphasizing the roles of parental quality and wing growth (rather than increase in mass), to explain the close correspondence between the model's predictions and patterns in the timing of nest departure within the Alcidae that are reported frequently.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Hull, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada","Hipfner, JM (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Biopsychol Programme, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.",30,19,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1999,80,"2",NA,NA,NA,587,"596",NA,"10.2307/176637",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In the model analyzed in greatest detail, there: is a limiting similarity in prey vulnerabilities in cycling systems, although such a limit does not exist in similar stable systems. The responses of mean population densities to model parameters often differ qualitatively between stable and unstable systems. In stable systems with two prey species, enrichment always increases the density of the prey that is poorer at resource exploitation and better at predator avoidance, while decreasing the density of the: other prey. In contrast, in some unstable systems, enrichment increases the densities of both prey, and in others it increases the better exploiter at the expense of the better predator avoider. Enrichment increases the amplitude of population cycles; for predators with saturating functional responses, larger cycles tend to favor the mure vulnerable species.

The interspecific signaling molecule named A-factor was present in amoebae culture medium at a concentration of 0.01 mu g peptide/L, corresponding to 2 x 10(-12) mol/L. Amoebae released similar to 3 x 10(5) molecules of A-factor per individual per hour. Prey ciliates added to solutions containing A-factor exhibited predator-avoidance behavior after a few hours. The discovery of a second function for this peptide-kairomone indicated why the predator betrays its presence to the prey and thereby unintentionally protects it. Inhibition of phagocytosis by particle-bound kairomone revealed that it also functions as a self-recognition signal in the predator. Phagocytosis of particles by amoebae depended on the amount of A-factor on the particle surface and decreased in linear correlation to the logarithm of peptide amount. Self-recognition prevents a mutual consumption of amoebae, leading to increased survival of these asexually reproducing organisms. The importance of self-recognition apparently outweighs the disadvantages of defense induction, since only few prey species of the omnivorous predator respond in this manner.","Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Ecol, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany","Kusch, J (corresponding author), Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Ecol, Erwin Schrodinger Str 14, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",20,10,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","MAR",1999,80,"2",NA,NA,NA,715,"720",NA,NA,6,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Using environmental data collected at semi-exposed rocky intertidal beaches in the northeastern Pacific, I compared predictions of the body temperatures of mussels (Mytilus californianus) based on small-scale (microclimate-level) environmental data averaged over a range of time scales (5 minutes to 1 hour) to those generated using continuous measurements. The error in predicting maximum and mean body temperatures introduced through the use of hourly environmental averages was generally less than 1 degrees-2 degrees C, I then predicted body temperatures of mussels during aerial exposure using historical, hourly weather data from federal meteorological databases. I used environmental data collected over a 30-yr (1961-1990) period on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State to estimate the body temperatures of mussel aggregations at two tidal heights under conditions of aerial exposure during a typical climatological year. Estimated body temperatures commonly fluctuated by 20 degrees C or more during a period of less than or equal to 12 h and did not correlate well with air temperatures. The data indicated that mussels were, on average, hotter at this site during spring (April-June) than in summer (July-September) and colder in autumn (October-December) than in winter (January-March), primarily due to the effect of tidal cycles in determining exposure time. Results of simulations where the effects of climate and tidal cycle were decoupled suggested that the timing of aerial exposure, which can vary consistently over relatively small spatial scales (<100 km), can he more important than seasonal (spring vs, summer) differences in climatic conditions in determining body temperatures. Because of the interactive effects of climate and tidal cycle on body temperatures, populations of mussels in this region living at the same tidal height but separated by only tens of kilometers are predicted to experience very different thermal regimes. As a result, the intertidal environment represents a unique habitat for investigating the thermal biology of invertebrates over a range of spatial and temporal scales.","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Helmuth, B (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hopkins Marine Stn, Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",100,31,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1999,80,"1",NA,NA,NA,15,"34",NA,NA,20,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Landscape simulation models offer an approach to studying such systems at broad scales. Fire can be simulated spatially using mechanistic or stochastic approaches. We describe the fire module in a spatially explicit, stochastic model of forest landscape dynamics (LANDIS) that incorporates fire, windthrow, and harvest disturbance with species-level succession. A stochastic approach is suited to forest landscape models that are designed to simulate patterns over large spatial and time domains and are not used deterministically to predict individual events. We used the model to examine how disturbance regimes and species dynamics interact across a large (500 000 ha), heterogeneous landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA, with six land types having different species environments, and fire disturbance return intervals varying from 200 to 1000 yr. The model shows that there are feedbacks over time between species, disturbance, and environment, resulting in the re-emergence of patterns that characterized the landscape before extensive alteration. Landscape equilibrium of species com position and age-class structure develops at three scales from the initial, disturbed landscape. Over 100-150 yr, fine-grained successional processes cause gradual disaggregation of the initial pattern of relatively homogenous composition and age classes. Species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), largely removed from the landscape by past human activities. only slowly re-invade. Next, patterns on the various land types diverge, driven by different disturbance regimes and dominant species. Finally, aging of the landscape causes the probabilities of larger and more severe fires to increase, and a coarse-grained pattern develops from the disturbance patches. Influence of adjacent land types is shown as fires spread across land type boundaries, although modified in spread and severity. As found by others, altered landscapes are likely to retain their modified pattern for centuries, suggesting that nonequilibrium conditions between tree species and climate will persist under predicted rates of climate change. The results suggest that this modeling approach can be useful in examining species level, broad-scale responses of heterogeneous landscapes to changes in landscape disturbance, such as modified management or land-use scenarios, or effects of global change.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Mladenoff, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",321,129,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1999,80,"1",NA,NA,NA,81,"99",NA,"10.2307/176981",19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

By examining how flowering varied across vegetative associations, I determined whether plant size or mass influenced flowering, whether canopy openness or increased soil fertility following fire enhanced flowering, and whether potential flowering stimuli interacted. Individuals of the widespread Serenoa repens and narrow endemic Sabal etonia were monitored (for a total of 9900 plant-year records) for growth performance and reproduction in flatwoods, scrubby flatwoods, scrub, and sandhill that were affected by single or multiple fires. In addition, clipping, fertilizing, and clipping+fertilizing experiments were conducted in three vegetative associations to simulate the effects of fire in order to ascertain which stimuli and their interactions encouraged flowering episodes. Both species exhibited marked resiliency to fire, rapidly resprouting from extensive underground stores. The frequencies of leaf production and flowering increased dramatically following fire in all vegetative associations compared to preburn periods, but especially in long-unburned (>60 yr) associations with substantial preburn overstory canopies, Strong episodic flowering responses were triggered after each of three repeated burns conducted during an 8-yr period at a previously long-unburned sandhill. Size, and hence estimated mass, were significant predictors of whether a palm would flower and, if so, how much it flowered. The loss of a palm's crown by fire, or by clipping, stimulated flowering, but this effect was mediated by Light availability. Palms under more complete overstory canopies flowered less than those in light gaps or at open-canopied stands. Fertilization of palms, intended to simulate greater postfire nutrient availabilities, did not stimulate flowering. Logistic regression models were developed for each palm species to estimate the probability of flowering in each vegetative association. These models accurately predicted flowering and nonflowering individuals. However, probability-of-flowering models that were generalized across vegetative associations for each species were less accurate than the association-specific models, which suggests the specific nature of flowering responses. These long-lived palms are well adapted to fire but are highly vulnerable to human-caused disturbance because of their very limited ability to recolonize former habitats.","Bucknell Univ, Dept Biol, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA; Archbold Biol Stn, Lake Placid, FL 33852 USA","Abrahamson, WG (corresponding author), Bucknell Univ, Dept Biol, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",44,19,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1999,80,"1",NA,NA,NA,100,"115",NA,NA,16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions: (1) the steady-state population density increased with an increase of the incident light intensity, (2) the steady-state population density (per unit volume) was inversely proportional to mixing depth, (3) the steady-state population size (per unit area) decreased linearly with mixing depth, (4) the critical light intensity decreased with an increase of the incident light intensity, (5) the critical light intensity was approximately the same at each mixing depth, and (6) the time courses predicted by the model were in line with the observed time courses of population density and light penetration.

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of five lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on five blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark-recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species (sympatric islands) compared to allopatric islands. In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined. The observed absence of A. sagrei from these islands may indicate that its dispersal abilities are limited relative to the frequency of devastating hurricanes.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Losos, JB (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",50,22,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1999,80,"1",NA,NA,NA,252,"258",NA,"10.2307/176994",7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The analytical issue is that unmeasured factors may be the active limiting constraint and may induce a pattern of unequal variation in the biological response variable through an interaction with the measured factors. Consequently, changes near the maxima, rather than at the center of response distributions, are better estimates of the effects expected when the observed factor is the active limiting constraint. Regression quantiles provide estimates for linear models tit to any part of a response distribution, including near the upper bounds, and require minimal assumptions about the form of the error distribution. Regression quantiles extend the concept of one-sample quantiles to the linear model by solving an optimization problem of minimizing an asymmetric function of absolute errors. Rank-score tests for regression quantiles provide tests of hypotheses and confidence intervals for parameters in linear models with heteroscedastic errors, conditions likely to occur in models of limiting ecological relations. We used selected regression quantiles (e.g., 5th, 10th,..., 95th) and confidence intervals to test hypotheses that parameters equal zero for estimated changes in average annual acorn biomass due to forest canopy cover of oak (Quercus spp.) and oak species diversity. Regression quantiles also were used to estimate changes in glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) seedling numbers as a function of lily flower numbers, rockiness, and pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides fossor) activity, data that motivated the query by Thomson et al. for new statistical procedures. Both example applications showed that effects of limiting factors estimated by changes in some upper regression quantile (e.g., 90-95th) were greater than if effects were estimated by changes in the means from standard linear model procedures. Estimating a range of regression quantiles (e.g., 5-95th) provides a comprehensive description of biological response patterns for exploratory and inferential analyses in observational studies of limiting factors, especially when sampling large spatial and temporal scales.","US Geol Survey, Midcontinent Ecol Sci Ctr, Biol Resources Div, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA","Cade, BS (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Midcontinent Ecol Sci Ctr, Biol Resources Div, 4512 McMurry Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA.",393,87,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1999,80,"1",NA,NA,NA,311,"323",NA,NA,13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Bird species differed in both quantity and quality components of seed dispersal. Bird species that contributed most to the quantity component of seed dispersal were not always the same as those that contributed most to the quality component. Thus, to evaluate the ecological roles of frugivores and their effectiveness as seed dispersers requires integration across various processes involved in seed dispersal (removal, deposition, etc.).

In northern Patagonia, Argentina, we related regional-scale tree mortality events over the past similar to 100 years to annual and decadal-scale climatic variations associated with changes in the major synoptic climatic controls of the southeastern Pacific region, including the El Ni (n) over tilde o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In nine stands of Austrocedrus chilensis, a xeric conifer, we used dendrochronological techniques to date the outermost tree ring on dead-standing and fallen trees to estimate the dates of tree death for 336 trees. To evaluate climatic conditions during periods of high tree mortality, we used regional records of precipitation and temperature from six climate stations and also used a regional set of 24 tree ring chronologies from Austrocedrus. Good preservation of the resinous wood of Austrocedrus allowed relatively precise dating of tree deaths over the past similar to 90 years. Episodes of massive tree mortality coincide with exceptionally dry springs and summers during the 1910s, 1942-1943, and the; 1950s. Although there is a general regional synchroneity of tree death associated with drought, intra-regional variations in the intensity of droughts, as interpolated and mapped from the regional network of tree ring chronologies, are also reflected by north-to-south variations in tree mortality patterns. Periods of drought and associated tree mortality during the 20th century in northern Patagonia are strongly associated with above average sea level atmospheric pressure off the coast of Chile at the same latitudes. Temperature and precipitation in northern Patagonia are highly influenced by the intensity and latitudinal position of the southeastern Pacific anticyclone, which, in turn, are greatly affected by ENSO. Tree mortality in northern Patagonia appears to be intensified by extreme events of the Southern Oscillation and is more strongly coincident with El Ni (n) over tilde o events along the coast of northern Peru. These results, in combination with previously established climatic influences on fire occurrence and tree seedling establishment, strongly link stand-level and regional-scale forest dynamic processes in northern Patagonia with variations in large-scale atmospheric conditions.","Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IANIGLA, Dept Dendrocronol & Hist Ambiental, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Villalba, R (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IANIGLA, Dept Dendrocronol & Hist Ambiental, CC 330, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina.",127,30,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1998,79,"8",NA,NA,NA,2624,"2640",NA,NA,17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

A multifactorial field experiment was conducted from June 1994 to October 1995 in a turf-dominated macroalgal assemblage on a rocky subtidal shore south of Livorno (western Mediterranean, Italy) to test the hypothesis that variable patterns of disturbance and stress influence the differential success of species, and to identify functional characteristics resulting in persistent monopolization of space. The experiment, which included manipulation of the depositional environment, was designed specifically to test whether patterns of recovery following abrasion or removal of the biota differed among patches of different sizes, produced at different times of the year and at different locations and undergoing different rates of sediment deposition. Variable size, intensity, timing and location of disturbance, and variable stress induced by deposition of sediment significantly influenced the success of erect algae that persist by sexual reproduction but did not affect spatial dominance by the filamentous algal turf. The turf regained space very quickly by vegetative reproduction and persisted as the dominant species in all the experimental plots, independent of the disturbance and stress regimes imposed. The impressive rate of vegetative propagation was identified as a major determinant of the structure of the assemblage and the probable basis for the capability of the turf to compete for space and resist disturbance. Patterns of growth may be as crucial as the disturbance regime in determining community structure, and packaging of competitive and resistance abilities into a single species or group of species could be more common than generally thought.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Airoldi, L (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",199,66,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1998,79,"8",NA,NA,NA,2759,"2770",NA,"10.2307/176515",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Previously applied methods for estimating tiger abundance, using total counts based on tracks, have proved unreliable. Lack of reliable data on tiger densities not only has constrained our ability to understand the ecological factors shaping communities of large, solitary felids, but also has undermined the effective conservation of these animals. In this paper, we describe the use of a field method proposed by Karanth (1995), which combines camera-trap photography, to identify individual tigers, with theoretically well-founded capture-recapture models. We developed a sampling design for camera-trapping and used the approach to estimate tiger population size and density in four representative tiger habitats indifferent parts of India. The field method worked well and provided data suitable for analysis using closed capture-recapture models. The results suggest the potential for applying this methodology to rigorously estimate abundances, survival rates, and other population parameters for tigers and other low-density, secretive animal species in which individuals can be identified based on natural markings. Estimated probabilities of photo-capturing tigers present in the study sites ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Estimated densities of tigers > 1 yr old ranged from 4.1 +/- 1.31 to 16.8 +/- 2.96 tigers/100 km(2) (mean +/- 1 se). Simultaneously, we used line-transect sampling to determine that mean densities of principal tiger prey at these sites ranged from 56.1 to 63.8 ungulates/km(2). Tiger densities appear to be positively associated with prey densities, except at one site influenced by tiger poaching. Our results generally support the prediction that relative abundances of large felid species may be governed primarily by the abundance and structure of their prey communities.","Wildlife Conservat Soc, Int Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA","Karanth, KU (corresponding author), 403 Seebo Apts,26-2 Aga Abbas Ali Rd, Bangalore 560042, Karnataka, India.",763,299,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1998,79,"8",NA,NA,NA,2852,"2862",NA,NA,11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Ungulates also can influence soil dynamics; however the relative contribution of large herbivores to controlling grassland soil processes remains largely unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of native migratory ungulates and variable site (landscape) conditions, caused by combined climatic and topographic variability, on grassland of the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park by determining soil C and N dynamics inside and outside 33-37 yr exclosures at seven diverse sites. Sites included hilltop, slope, and slope bottom positions across a climatic gradient and represented among the driest and wettest grasslands on the northern winter range. We performed two experiments: (1) a 12-mo in situ net N mineralization study and (2) a long-term (62-wk) laboratory incubation to measure potential N mineralization and microbial respiration. Results from the in situ experiment indicated that average net N mineralization among grazed plots (3.8 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)) was double that of fenced, ungrazed plots (1.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)). Mean grazer enhancement of net N mineralization across sites (1.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)) approached the maximum difference in net N mineralization among fenced plots (2.2 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)), i.e., the greatest landscape effect observed. Furthermore, ungulates substantially increased between-site variation in mineralization; grazed grassland, 1 SD = 2.2 g N . m(-2).yr(-1), fenced grassland, 1 so = 0.85 g N . m(-2).yr(-1). In the long-term incubation, potential microbial respiration and net N mineralization were positively related to total soil C and N content, respectively. There was greater variation in potential respiration and net N mineralization early in the incubation, when labile material was processed, compared to late in the incubation, when more recalcitrant substrate was processed, suggesting that between-site variation in labile organic matter was greater than that of recalcitrant material. Herbivores improved the organic matter quality of soil, increasing the labile fractions and reducing the recalcitrant fractions. Grazers reduced C respired/N mineralized ratios, an index of microbial N immobilization, by an average of 21%. However, the largest landscape influence on the immobilization index was 13-fold greater than the grazer effect. Given that the greatest landscape influence on in situ net mineralization (2.2 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)) was similar to the average grazer impact on that rate(1.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)), we hypothesize that the landscape effect on field N availability was primarily caused by variation in microbial immobilization, while the grazing effect was primarily due to stimulation of gross mineralization. These results indicate that the relative importance of ungulates in controlling soil N cycling may be more important than previously suspected for grasslands supporting large herds of migratory ungulates, and that the dominant mechanisms underlying the landscape and ungulate influences on soil mineral fluxes may differ.","Syracuse Univ, Biol Res Labs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Frank, DA (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Biol Res Labs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",269,125,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1998,79,"7",NA,NA,NA,2229,"2241",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2229:UVLCOS]2.0.CO;2",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits. Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species.

Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs. Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species. Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species. The study shows how a suite of inter-related ecophysiological and life history traits can result in a diversity of pioneer tree ecologies.","Harvard Univ Hebaria, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Brunei Darussalam, Biol Dept, Bandar Seri Begawan 2028, Brunei","Davies, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Inst Biodivers & Environm Conservat, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia.",73,30,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1998,79,"7",NA,NA,NA,2292,"2308",NA,NA,17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The rapid, apparently synchronous, and species-specific nature of the decline suggests that it was the result of a pathogenic outbreak. T. canadensis is a highly shade-tolerant, long-lived conifer, and its sudden removal from the canopy is likely to have had an impact on forest composition, structure, and function. The response of forest vegetation to the mid-Holocene hemlock decline at two sites in southern Ontario, Canada was examined using paleoecological methods. At one site, where T. canadensis declined sharply, several other forest taxa increased in abundance, resulting in a long-term shift in forest composition. At a second site, pollen percentages of T. canadensis did not decrease so dramatically, and less change in forest composition occurred. At both sites, T. canadensis took similar to 2000 yr to recover from the decline and reach former abundance levels. This study suggests that the mid-Holocene decline of a forest dominant may have had a long-term impact on forest composition in northeastern North America.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge, England","Fuller, JL (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Bot, Palaeoenvironm Res Unit, Galway, Ireland.",55,8,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","OCT",1998,79,"7",NA,NA,NA,2337,"2351",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2337:EIOTMH]2.0.CO;2",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This paradox of enrichment has rarely been tested, although it has been observed in laboratory populations of mites and protozoans. In this paper, replicated laboratory microcosms containing planktonic rotifer predators and phytoplankton prey were used to explore the effects of enrichment on predator population dynamics. Prey enrichment was accomplished by increasing the input concentration of prey into predator chemostat flasks, which is equivalent to increasing prey carrying capacity and growth rate. Enrichment stabilized predator dynamics, reducing population variability and reducing the occurrence and strength of population cycles. This is the first experimental demonstration of a reversal of the paradox of enrichment. Rotifers produced an autotoxic compound that reduced population growth rate and individual survival. Since predators were more abundant in the enriched microcosms, dynamics may have been stabilized by a toxin-mediated density-dependent death rate. These results support recent theories suggesting that predator density dependence can result in stabilization by enrichment and may help explain the scarcity of examples of the paradox of enrichment in nature.","New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Biol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA","Kirk, KL (corresponding author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Biol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",67,20,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1998,79,"7",NA,NA,NA,2456,"2462",NA,"10.2307/176835",7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We tested whether elevational ranges of montane butterflies conform to Rapoport's elevational rule (species at higher elevations have greater elevational ranges). We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis (emigrants from higher elevation populations inflate the species richness of lower-elevation sites) could explain the species richness patterns we observed. In addition, we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradients in butterfly species richness. Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational bands in 17 canyons. Elevation and species richness were significantly negatively correlated, although species richness peaked at intermediate elevations, and butterflies in species-rich areas had significantly narrower elevational ranges than species in more depauperate areas. Toiyabe Range butterflies conformed to Rapoport's elevational rule. The Rapoport effect we documented did not result from sampling bias. However, the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis cannot fully explain the elevational gradient in species richness. Environmental severity at either end and favorable conditions near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high species richness at intermediate elevations. Our models indicated that few butterfly taxa will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change. To maintain present species richness and maximize the potential of Great Basin butterflies to adapt to rapid climate change, we recommend that habitat protection and restoration efforts target not only high elevation Wilderness Areas but also intermediate elevations.","Univ Nevada, Dept Biol 314, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Nevada State Museum & Hist Soc, Las Vegas, NV 89107 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Fleishman, E (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",131,37,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","OCT",1998,79,"7",NA,NA,NA,2482,"2493",NA,"10.2307/176837",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The standard deviation of a series of estimated parameter values (e.g., estimated population size) or some function thereof (e.g., log of the estimated parameters) is commonly used as a measure of temporal variability. These measures of temporal variation overestimate the true temporal variation by not accounting for sampling variability inherent to the estimation of unknown population parameters. Using a variance-components approach to partitioning the total variability of an estimated parameter, we demonstrate the ease with which sampling variation can be removed from the observed total variation of parameter estimates. Estimates of temporal variability of survival are given after removal of sampling variation for three bird species: the federally listed Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii), Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus), and Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Sampling variation accounted for the majority of the total variation in the survival estimates for nearly all of the populations studied.

Ontogenetic reaction norms, in contrast, describe how phenotypes unfold during growth in different environments. We studied the ontogenetic reaction norms of the morphological shape of a series of defensive abdominal spines in dragonfly larvae, both in the laboratory and in a number of natural populations. In a laboratory rearing experiment, we demonstrated that these spines grew more solid and elongated when waterborne environmental cues of fish predators were present: this is evidence of phenotypic plasticity in defensive spine morphology. The ontogenetic reaction norms of defensive spines were also found to differ in natural populations with and without fish. A detailed analysis of the growth trajectories showed that this differentiation was primarily due to ontogenetic acceleration in environments with fish, leading to relatively exaggerated spine shape in these environments. However, while the ontogenetic trajectories of shape in some spines diverged at the onset of ontogeny in the two environments, those of others remained parallel until a given phase of ontogeny. Hence, the timing of the developmental divergence of these phenotypically integrated traits differed, suggesting differences in the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our results illustrate that a conceptual integration of environmental and ontogenetic approaches to the study of phenotypic differentiation can significantly promote our understanding of the ecology and evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Arnqvist, G (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",78,30,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","SEP",1998,79,"6",NA,NA,NA,1847,"1858",NA,"10.2307/176693",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Diving activity and position of the birds were determined via externally attached logging units. Feeding behavior was detected using stomach temperature sensors. All calculated positions of the birds occurred south of Possession Island. The area most frequented was situated 250 km south of the island (48.5 degrees S), where birds stayed for 40 h during a foraging trip, on average. The overall swim speed differed with time into the foraging trip, being lowest during the central part and highest (10 km/h) during the last night at sea, when birds were returning to the colony. Diving activities showed a clear diurnal pattern, with maximum dive depth being dependent on ambient light levels. During the night, only shallow dives <30 m were made, whereas deep dives occurred only during daylight. Preferred dive depths during deep diving ranged from 100 to 200 m. Maximum dive depth was 323 m, and maximum dive duration was 9.2 min. Vertical velocity (rate of change of depth) and dive duration were significantly correlated with increasing dive depth. Time spent at depth changed with time into the foraging trip, with most time being spent in deep water strata during the central phase, whereas predominately shallow dives were executed at the beginning and at the end of the foraging trips. Feeding success was closely linked to time of day, dive depth, and time into the foraging trip. Overall, >85% of the feeding events occurred during daylight and at twilight. Mean food mass ingested was calculated to be similar to 2350 g/d, with the highest amounts ingested during the central and penultimate days of the foraging trip. Foraging success (grams ingested per unit time underwater) was also highest (>370 g/h) at this time.

The feeding ecology of two species of flying fox, Pteropus samoensis and Pteropus tonganus on the Samoan archipelago, was examined in detail by direct observation and by examining feeding refuse. P. samoensis and P. tonganus fed on over 78 plant species from 39 families throughout their range and on over 69 plant species in Samoa alone. Flying foxes interacted with 59% of the forest tree species in Amalau Valley for fruit or flower resources. Twenty-eight percent of the forest trees were commonly used, and 79% of forest canopy trees were used. Broad overlap in resource use was noted between P. samoensis and P. tonganus with over 22 shared plant species. Seasonal variation in fruit resource use was quantified with a preference index. Flying foxes ate a taxonomically nonrandom subset of fruit species and generally preferred primary forest fruits to those in the secondary forest. Six plant families (Sapotaceae, Mrytaceae, Moraceae, Combretaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapindaceae) were particularly important to flying foxes in Samoa. However, a set of core plant taxa does not exist for Pteropus spp, in Samoa.

However, the factors underlying fluctuating asymmetry, especially in plants, remain poorly understood. We sampled leaf fluctuating asymmetry among and within three species of even-aged birch (Betula pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula) and their interspecific hybrids growing in common gardens of northern Finland to determine whether hybridization and environmental stress are associated with increased developmental instability. Our predictions were that: (1) interspecific hybrids among B. pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula would have enhanced leaf FA compared to the parent groups because of a possible disruption of coadapted genomes; (2) intermediates between Betula pubescens sap. tortuosa and B. pubescens ssp. pubescens would have a slight decrease or no difference in leaf FA compared to the parent group; and (3) fluctuating asymmetry would increase between a low-elevation and a tree-line-elevation site, and this increase would be greater in B. pubescens, which forms the major subarctic community below the tree line, than in B. nana, which is common above the tree line. As predicted, leaf FA was higher in the tree-line common garden than in the lower elevation garden, but the amount of increase was not significantly different between B. pubescens and B. nana. Leaf asymmetry was also higher in hybrids than in parental taxa, and this response was fairly consistent among the three crosses. This suggests that interspecific hybridization resulted in higher developmental instability. Furthermore, in the intraspecific studies with B. pubescens, there was no relationship between tree height (an intraspecific hybrid index) and leaf asymmetry. Thus, these data support the ideas of Markow (1995) that the changes in asymmetry observed from hybridization will be a function of how closely related parental taxa are. Since leaf FA in Betula pubescens increased with elevation and hybridization, and both are important in tree-line dynamics, FA might be a useful indicator of stress and distributional limits in this and possibly other plant species.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Ecol Zool Lab, Turku 20014, Finland","Wilsey, BJ (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",83,26,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","SEP",1998,79,"6",NA,NA,NA,2092,"2099",NA,"10.2307/176712",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Field-tracking recordings of individual beetles are fitted to a biased random walk (BRW) model and inserted into the IBM together with data on settling behavior. Beetles will often stop and rest during their activity periods. A range of probabilities for alternation between active and resting behavior are tested in the model at several prey levels. We found that at large scales, in this case movement over hundreds of meters and several seasons, diffusion is a good approximation for population spread. At small scales of around one meter, BRW describes movement accurately. At intermediate scales we need both BRW, resting, and changes between these behaviors to describe motion effectively in the model. The area covered by the beetles increases linearly over time, while the maximum distance moved does not, indicating an approximately circular expansion and a thorough search of area traversed. Seasonal range and estimated rate of movement differed among species depending on prey availability but was not correlated to body size.","Univ Uppsala, Dept Quantum Chem, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Royal Inst Technol, Dept Math, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden","Firle, S (corresponding author), Univ Uppsala, Dept Quantum Chem, Box 518, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",63,32,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","SEP",1998,79,"6",NA,NA,NA,2113,"2122",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2113:TIOMAR]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The intensity and direction of the interaction were determined by comparing the combined and individual impacts of both predators. In a laboratory mesocosm, the combined predation rate of both predators was nearly double the sum of their individual predation rates. The mechanism for the interaction was the aphid dropping behavior elicited by C. septempunctata, which rendered the aphids susceptible to predation by H. pennsylvanicus on the ground. The strength of the synergistic interaction increased with increasing prey density. The interaction between the predators was also demonstrated in both open and closed field cages where the combined impact of the two predators on aphid population growth was significantly greater than the sum of their individual impacts.

However, the reasons for the variability of DOC flows are unknown. Phytophagous insects such as aphids have not been considered a potential source of organic carbon, even though aphids feeding on trees excrete copious amounts of honeydew. We followed the key processes determining the origin, flow, and path of honeydew from the phyllosphere of a Norway spruce stand to the soil. We analyzed the chemical composition of needle leachates, throughfall, and soil solution to calculate fluxes of DOC and hexose-C in an aphid-infested and an uninfested Norway spruce stand. At the individual aphid level, the amount of honeydew produced was dependent on temperature, developmental stage, and the nutritional status of spruce. At the population level, colony growth and natural enemies influenced the amount of honeydew available in the phyllosphere. The growth rates of microorganisms on spruce needles were significantly increased when honeydew was available. This study of the fate of honeydew and associated metabolites within a forest stand shows that the concentrations of DOC and hexose-C in throughfall were reduced on the way to the soil and that there were no differences in the soil solutions from infested and uninfested stands. However, the distribution and abundance of honeydew-producing Homoptera had a marked effect on the spatial and temporal variability in the DOC concentrations in throughfall. High DOC concentrations in throughfall during summer are not exclusively due to the leaching of nutrients from leaves, but may also be attributed to the excreta of aphids. Our results highlight the importance of studying physiological and life history processes in addition to taking the traditional biomass approach to ecosystem studies. We discuss our results with regard to the types of information that are preserved, transformed, or lost when crossing the conceptual border between one scale of observation and another. We emphasize the importance of identifying key processes at different spatiotemporal scales by linking the biology of individuals and populations with flows of energy and matter within an ecosystem, while stressing the need to identify ecosystem changes at different scales of observation.","Univ Bayreuth, Inst terr Ecosyst, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Inst Microbiol Ecol & Soil Biol, D-14641 Paulinenaue, Germany; Ctr Agr Landscape & Land Use Res, Muncheberg, Germany","Stadler, B (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Inst terr Ecosyst, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",76,19,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1514,"1525",NA,"10.2307/176773",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

For the first time, in this experiment, we have considered irradiance as a factor, in combination with animal prey, for an array of natural field conditions. The goal was to determine how carnivory translates to fitness within different radiation regimes. For this, it was necessary to quantify an array of plant responses, such as survival, growth, reproduction (sexual and vegetative reproduction), as well as responses related to carnivory investment (leaf shape and mucilage secretion). Both irradiance and animal food supply proved to be important limiting factors for P. vallisneriifolia under field conditions. Plants clearly decreased in performance from the sunny habitat to the deep-shade one, with plants growing in the least irradiance registering the lowest values for all variables analyzed. The dearest response to prey was the production of axillary buds. Most vegetative acid reproductive responses depended heavily on the initial biomass of the plant before the experiments, the largest plants bearing the most leaves, flowers, stolons, and axillary buds. A gradient from less to more mucilage secretion appeared from deep-shade to sunny habitat, and within each habitat from prey exclusion to prey addition levels. Trapped prey stimulated digestive secretions in a positive feedback (the more prey, the more mucilage secretion) under all irradiance conditions. The curled, more secretory leaves of the sunny plants, in comparison with the nearly flattened, less secretory leaves of the deep-shade plants, illustrate the constraints imposed by differing scenarios on the capture of both prey and photons. With nonlimiting water availability, more irradiance and prey results in more survival, growth, and sexual and vegetative reproduction. Nevertheless, it is not usual to find an optimum combination of resources (i.e., irradiance, prey, and water) available in the same microhabitat during the Mediterranean summer. The spatial uncoupling of limiting resources progressively increased towards the extremes of the irradiance gradient (sunny and deep-shade habitats, respectively), and therefore the dual photosynthetic and carnivore functions of P. vallisneriifolia leaves were not equally efficient in all habitats. These opposing resource gradients determined all vegetative and reproductive plant responses. The perennial character of this endemic plant, together with its vegetative form of propagation, allows the possibility of resisting extinction even in the absence of seedling recruitment or when vegetative growth is strongly limited.","Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol ANim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Zamora, R (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol ANim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",53,53,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1630,"1644",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1630:FROACP]2.0.CO;2",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Mechanical defense of 115 plant species, in the form of seed strength, was measured using two techniques, a Universal Force Tester and pressure applied with forceps. Most species tested had relatively strong seeds (> 20 N), though a significant minority had relatively weak seeds. Preliminary findings of contrasts across independent phylogenetic divergences suggest there was no consistent tendency for seed strength to be greater in species adapted for ant dispersal compared to their relatives that are not. In seed removal assays performed in the field, weaker seeds were more likely to be removed than stronger seeds, whether elaiosomes were present or not. Weaker seeds were also more likely to be eaten than stronger seeds. In laboratory seed predation assays, strong seeds were rarely eaten by two common seed-removing ant species (Rhytidoponera metallica and Pheidole sp. 4). In contrast, species with relatively weak seeds experienced much higher levels of seed predation, up to 100%. In conclusion, the majority of species adapted for ant dispersal produce relatively strong seeds, and this may explain the low level of predation recorded for these species.","Macquarie Univ, Sch Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Rodgerson, L (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Dept Sci Biol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",55,22,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1669,"1677",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1669:MDISAF]2.0.CO;2",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

A relative paucity of evidence for such trophic cascades in terrestrial systems has prompted proposals that resource availability (donor control) is more critical than are top-down forces in structuring terrestrial communities, and that trophic cascades with top-down dominance will be restricted to systems of low species diversity. To test the effects of a fourth trophic level on successive lower trophic levels under different levels of plant resource availability, we used Piper ant-plants and their associated arthropods as a model system in lowland, tropical rain forest. This interacting web of four trophic levels is composed of small trees, various herbivores, predaceous ants, and specialist clerid beetles as predators of ants. Three-hundred-sixty Piper cenocladum cuttings were randomly assigned to 36 plots with a factorial design: predator treatment (three levels), light treatment (two levels), and soil type (two levels). We monitored indicators of ant-colony size (percentage petioles occupied per tree), herbivore loads (leaf area loss), and tree biomass (total leaf area per tree) for 18 mo. When the top predator Tarsobaenus letourneauae was added experimentally to the three-trophic-level ant-plant system, the average abundance of Pheidole bicornis ants was reduced fivefold, average herbivory to Piper cenocladum leaves was increased nearly threefold, and tree leaf area was reduced by nearly half. Direct effects of predatory beetles on ants were more pronounced and more rapid than were indirect effects accumulating to the second and first trophic levels. Bottom-up effects of light and soil quality tended to be mitigated by these top-down cascades. Neither potential leaf-area accumulation by trees nor actual leaf area (left after herbivory) showed a direct response to relatively high or low availability of soil nutrients or light at different sites.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Letourneau, DK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",84,78,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1678,"1687",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1678:ETILTF]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Nevertheless, dormant stages could potentially have significant impacts on the ecology and evolution of the active population. In Oneida Lake, New York, populations of the suspension-feeding crustaceans Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria produce large numbers of long-lived diapausing eggs, which accumulate in the sediments to densities of over 2.5 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. galeata mendotae and 8.0 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. pulicaria. Sedimentation rates obtained by Pb-210 dating suggest that these eggs can remain viable for > 125 yr and that these two Daphnia populations have persisted in this system for > 200 yr. Total annual production of new diapausing eggs can range from 0 to over 10(4) new eggs/ m(2) of sediment. Annual emergence rates back to the water column are also variable but only range between 0 and 25 Daphnia/m(2). Because annual variation in the size of the overwintering water-column population ranges between 0 and 2.5 individuals/L, the contribution of emergence to the development of the spring population is considerable in some years and negligible in others. Despite similar maximum water-column densities, D. pulicaria produces and stores more eggs and has a higher rate of emergence than D. galeata mendotae, suggesting differences in the benthic-pelagic link of these two species. Diapausing eggs greatly increase the generation time of the populations that produce them and therefore have the potential to substantially alter the outcome of community interactions.","Cornell Univ, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Caceres, CE (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",254,67,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1699,"1710",NA,"10.2307/176789",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The release of gametes by Focus distichus occurred in still water under high light and was associated with the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in tide pools isolated from the ocean during daytime low tides. Diurnal patterns of gamete release that lasted for 2-3 d, as in natural populations, were found in receptacles cultured in a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod under calm conditions or in a simulated tidal regime. Constant light disrupted the diurnal component of release, however, suggesting that an endogenous circadian periodicity was absent. The effects of increased [DIC] on cultured receptacles under calm conditions were similar to the inhibitory effects of high water motion; both conditions reduced release in several species from both tide pool and intertidal habitats. Bicarbonate concentration, rather than carbon dioxide, or carbonate, was shown to be the component of the DIC system most closely correlated (inversely) with gamete release in the intertidal fucoid Pelvetia compressa. The hypothesis that gamete release is triggered by DIC depletion in the unstirred boundary layer during periods of low water motion in the light was further supported by experiments with P. compressa. These showed that gamete release was not inhibited by high water motion when DIC was absent. In the same experiments, high water motion inhibited release at 2 and 20 mmol/L DIC, confirming that the sensitivity of gamete release to water motion is DIC dependent. The ability of fucoid algae to couple physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis) with life history events (gamete release) allows external fertilization to occur under favorable hydrodynamic conditions, and may contribute greatly to reproductive success in organisms inhabiting periodically turbulent environments.","Univ Maine, Dept Plant Biol & Pathol, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Pearson, GA (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, UCTRA, Campus Gambelas, P-8000 Faro, Portugal.",89,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1725,"1739",NA,NA,15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

On Guam, the sponge Dysidea sp. overgrows the sponge Cacospongia sp. and causes necrosis. Using field assays, we tested the effects of crude organic extracts and a major sesquiterpene isolated from Dysidea, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane, on Cacospongia and on the production of the major terpenoid metabolites scalaradial and desacetylscalaradial by Cacospongia. We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea. However, a greater quantity of organic extract (but not scalaradial or desacetylscalaradial) was found in portions of Cacospongia covered by agar strips containing Dysidea organic extracts than in portions of Cacospongia covered by control agar strips. The production of 7-deacetoxyolepupuane by Dysidea occurring on rock substrates and on Cacospongia did not differ; thus, the production of this compound is not induced by the presence of competitors. In addition to its role in competition, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane deterred predation by a spongivorous fish, illustrating the multiple ecological roles that a single secondary metabolite may play.","Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA","Paul, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.",91,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1740,"1750",NA,NA,11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To trace the responses of vegetation to one particular type of disturbance, I sampled vegetation in 250 canopy gaps in 1976/1977, 1983, and 1990/1991. These gaps were located in three sites in the southern Appalachians of eastern North America: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Walker Cove Research Natural Area, and Joyce Kilmer Wilderness Area. Each gap was sampled thrice for sapling composition (stems greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter at breast height). Additional measurements included the extension growth of border trees into the gap, recent mortality rates of border trees, deterioration rates of gas makers that had been standing dead in earlier samples, and the composition of understory plots. The mean extension (branch) growth of border trees was 12 cm/yr, with slower growth by longer branches. Gap makers that had been tall stumps tended to deteriorate, although 35% stayed intact over the 14 yr of the study. Border-tree mortality averaged 0.60%/yr, with higher rates for larger stems and with much interspecific variation. Stem density of saplings in gaps increased during the first sampling interval and decreased during the second as self-thinning counteracted increased establishment. Basal area increased during both sampling intervals. The death of border trees increased basal area per unit gap area. The four main species (Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Halesia carolina) showed different patterns of correlation to gap size and age. Species in general showed more correlations with gap age for the first sample than afterwards; gap size was more consistently related to species importance. Species patterns also were affected by the presence or absence of border-tree mortality. The stands studied seem nearly at equilibrium. Some small changes are likely to occur, but the species present dominated all size classes: gap saplings, border trees, other canopy trees not related to gaps, and understory saplings. Species differed in their relative growth rates in the understory and in gaps of different sizes. Species also differed in their survival rates in the understory and in the canopy.","Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA","Runkle, JR (corresponding author), Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",94,29,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1998,79,"5",NA,NA,NA,1768,"1780",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1768:CISACT]2.0.CO;2",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Populations of hares cycle in abundance, with peaks in density occurring every 8-11 yr, and experimental results suggest that predation is a necessary factor causing these cycles. We measured the functional responses of coyotes and lynx during a cyclic fluctuation of hare populations in the southwest Yukon, to determine their effect on the cyclic dynamics. We used snow-tracking and radio telemetry to examine changes in the foraging behavior of the predators. Coyotes and lynx both fed mostly on hares during all winters except during cyclic lows, when the main alternative prey of coyotes was voles, and lynx switched to hunting red squirrels. Both predators showed clear functional responses to changes in the densities of hares. Kill rates of hares by coyotes varied from 0.3 to 2.3 hares/d, with the most hares killed one year before the cyclic peak, while those of lynx varied from 0.3 to 1.2 hares/d, with the highest one year after the peak. Maximum kill rates by both predators were greater than their energetic needs. The functional response of coyotes was equally well described by linear and type-2 curves, and that of lynx was well described by a type-2 curve. Kill rates by coyotes were higher during the increase in density of hares than during the cyclic decline, while the reverse was true for lynx. Coyotes killed more hares early in the winter, and cached many of these for later retrieval. Lower densities of hares were associated with longer reactive distances of both predators to hares, but with little apparent change in time spent searching or handling prey. In summary, our data show that the two similarly sized predators differed in their foraging behavior and relative abilities at capturing alternative prey, leading to different patterns in their functional responses to fluctuations in the density of their preferred prey.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Ecol Grp, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Biol, CONICET, INEUCI Inst, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","O'Donoghue, M (corresponding author), Box 251, Mayo, YT Y0B 1M0, Canada.",163,118,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1998,79,"4",NA,NA,NA,1193,"1208",NA,"10.2307/176736",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We test four hypotheses that might account for stability at high-nutrient levels: (1) greater abundance of inedible algae with enrichment interferes with Daphnia's feeding; (2) Daphnia's death rate increases with enrichment; (3) Daphnia's death rate increases with Daphnia density; (4) Daphnia's functional response depends on Daphnia's density.

Often, these ontogenetic changes are discrete and coincide with metamorphosis (e.g., amphibians), but more gradual niche changes can occur during growth. Identifying nondiscrete changes in diet and understanding their implications at the population and community levels are especially difficult for ecologists who study detritivores and other species that have poorly characterized diets. Theory and several lines of evidence suggest, however, that benthic juveniles of species that deposit feed as adults may be unable to meet their nutritional demands by deposit feeding. To reject the null hypothesis that both juveniles and adults of deposit-feeding species assimilate the same diet and to infer ontogenetic changes in diet, I used stable carbon isotopes as a natural diet tracer. I quantified body-size-dependent variations in the delta(13)C of four species of tentaculate, surface-deposit-feeding polychaetes: the ampharetid Hobsonia florida and the spionids Pseudopolydora kempi japonica, Polydora cornuta, and Pygospio elegans. In addition to worm tissues, I measured the isotopic compositions of the most likely primary producers at each field site (benthic diatoms, macroalgae, and saltmarsh grasses) to predict the worms' carbon sources. All species showed significant size-dependent variations in delta(13)C. Furthermore, populations of P. kempi japonica at two different sandflats had similar ontogenetic trends despite isotopic differences in available foods at each site. Individuals fed a fixed diet in the laboratory, however, did not show significant size-dependent variation in delta(13)C, leaving ontogenetic changes in diet as the most parsimonious explanation of the field data. Regression analyses indicated that the gradual change in delta(13)C(= with body size was nonlinear, with most of the change in delta(13)C occurring before individuals reach sexual maturity. The complex life cycle of these species, therefore, includes both a radical change in niche when larvae metamorphose to juveniles and a gradual niche shift as benthic juveniles grow. The isotopic data indicate that the smallest juveniles assimilated much of their carbon from benthic diatoms (delta(13)C approximate to -20 parts per thousand), while adults assimilated most of their carbon from detritus derived from macroalgae (delta(13)C approximate to -9 parts per thousand) or saltmarsh grasses (delta(13)C approximate to -14 parts per thousand). Because abundances of benthic diatoms or other high-quality components of sediment are more variable and more likely to be in limiting supply than detritus or bulk sedimentary organics, populations of species that deposit feed as adults may experience food-related recruitment bottlenecks during the juvenile stage.","Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Hentschel, BT (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",117,30,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUN",1998,79,"4",NA,NA,NA,1357,"1370",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1357:IVICIO]2.0.CO;2",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In this paper, we examine the role of flow velocities in governing community structure in marine intertidal communities. We broaden the traditional definition of bottom-up forces to include the delivery of nutrients, food, and larval resources to habitats and then test the hypothesis that, by controlling these fluxes as well as mediating predator effects, flow velocities leave strong bottom-up signatures on shoreline communities. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying community structure and dynamics at high and low flow sites in a tidal estuary in Maine. High flow sizes were characterized by dense barnacle and mussel cover, while low flow sites had considerable bare space. High flow sites also had greater grazer and predator densities than low flow sites. Recruitment of all common shoreline organisms with planktonic larvae was greater at high flow sites, in direct proportion to the increased fluid flux there. Flow effects on the growth of the herbivorous and carnivorous components of the food web were less predictable. High Bows increased the growth of barnacles, but not mussels, and increased the growth of the carnivorous gastropods that preyed on them. In contrast, high flows decreased the accumulation of benthic diatoms, but this was unrelated to the growth rates of herbivorous gastropods. High flow sites were universally characterized by low predation intensity and per capita predation rates on all three prey species. Our results show that the strength of top-down and bottom-up forces varies with flow rate in this estuary. Consumer stress (top-down) models accurately explain patterns we saw at low flow sites, but bottom-up processes predicted from nutrient/productivity models dominate at high Bow sites. High consumer pressure is the dominant structuring force at low flow sites, whereas at high flow sites predators are inhibited, and individual recruitment and growth rates become the dominant structuring forces. We suggest that hydrodynamics may commonly decouple predation and resource processes in many aquatic systems when the physical process responsible for variation in top-down forces also acts as a strong bottom-up force.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Leonard, GH (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",185,66,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUN",1998,79,"4",NA,NA,NA,1395,"1411",NA,NA,17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The model explicitly incorporates larval and adult dynamics for two species, one of which overgrows the other. Conclusions include: (1) The subordinate must be a stress tolerator or ruderal for coexistence with a competitive dominant. (2) The intermediate disturbance principle is a moderate-to-high settlement phenomenon: coexistence is possible at sufficiently low settlement even without the aid of disturbance, but at high settlement, a dominant with greater benthic ability excludes the subordinate at all levels of disturbance. (3) Given coexistence, increasing disturbance drives the dominant extinct first. (4) For a Erred level of disturbance, an intermediate recruitment hypothesis fields: at low settlement only the subordinate exists, at intermediate settlement there is coexistence, and at high settlement the dominant excludes the subordinate. (5) A gradient in settlement is sufficient to generate benthic zonation, so negative covariation between settlement and disturbance accentuates disturbance's effect, and positive covariation diminishes it. (6) The effects of area and settlement an coexistence in this model are equivalent.

Overwintering W. smithii suffered a 60% loss in fitness (R-0), comparable to the 68% loss in fitness imposed by the summer stress. Overwintering cohorts lost fitness through reduced survivorship, fecundity, fertility, adult longevity, and mass-specific fecundity. We argue that very real trade-offs occur between summer performance and winter performance among temperate insects in general.

On a broad geographic scale, young birds were highly philopatric, returning from wintering grounds several thousand kilometers away to nest on the same island and often in the same field where they had hatched the year before. In some cases, birds chose nest sites within a few meters of their natal nest. The median dispersal distance between a bird's natal nest and its first nest as an adult was 228 m, a distance equivalent to about six times the diameter of an average territory. Nearly three-quarters of the breeding birds in the study population had been banded as nestlings or fledglings within a 10-ha area on one island, which suggests that most birds in the population originated within the 127-ha archipelago. Within the archipelago, males and females dispersed similar distances from their natal site. There was no correlation between natal dispersal distances of parents and their offspring, nor was there a correlation between natal dispersal distances of siblings, which indicated that natal dispersal has low heritability. Sex, hatching date, fledging mass, and population densities during the previous and current years were all poor predictors of natal dispersal distance. Males that were strongly philopatric recruited significantly more offspring during their lifetime than males raised outside the study area, although there were no differences between philopatric and dispersing females. Birds tended to shift to distinct parts of the island to breed if their parents of the opposite sex still occupied the territory where they had hatched. Dispersal was not affected by return of same-sex parents. Distances between nests of siblings raised the same year were farther apart than expected by chance, based on Monte Carlo simulations. Although many birds in the population had the opportunity to pair with kin, some mechanism, yet to be determined, enabled birds to avoid inbreeding: in 1073 nesting attempts involving birds of known parentage, no individuals were known to have paired with close relatives (coefficient of kinship >0.125). Because complete inbreeding avoidance occurred in <1% of Monte Carlo simulations, the absence of inbreeding among Kent Island Savannah Sparrows is unlikely to be due to chance. Understanding natal dispersal in birds requires a combination of models: ecogenetic models at broad geographic scales (e.g., adaptation to local environments), ecological constraints and neutral models at smaller spatial scales (e.g., unavailability of territories within particular habitats), and genetic models (e.g., inbreeding avoidance).","Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Zool, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Wheelwright, NT (corresponding author), Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",123,32,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,755,"767",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0755:PNDAIA]2.0.CO;2",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In most species of strongly seasonal climates (e.g., trees of the cold temperate forests of North America and Japan), seed dispersal and seedling establishment are processes separated in time by at least a few weeks and more typically by a few months. This leaves ample opportunity for various factors to affect the spatial patterns of seed dispersal, survival and germination, and seedling emergence. Spatial uncoupling between these sequential processes leads to spatial independence (i.e., absence of a relationship) in the abundance patterns of life stages. Along a topographical gradient in an old-growth cold temperate forest of northeastern North America, I analyzed the spatial patterns of seed rain, seed bank, and seedling emergence of a major tree component, Betula alleghaniensis, over a 4-yr period. I examined the degree of consistency through time of the spatial patterns of each life stage and of their relationships with one another. Seed rain and seedling spatial patterns were quite variable through time, but that of the seed bank was relatively consistent despite large interyear fluctuations in abundance. Overall, two major spatial patterns emerged along the topographical gradient: one that emphasized the three peaks of density of mature Betula trees, and one with a single peak in the middle section of the gradient, where Betula tree density was higher. Correlations between the spatial patterns of seed and seedling abundance were significant in some years, but not in others. Seed survival was practically constant in space in one year, but quite variable in another; yet, it was consistently density independent. Spatial uncoupling was important between processes as reflected by the spatial independence between life-stage abundance patterns. This uncoupling significantly contributes to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the system and complicates fine-scale modeling of population and community dynamics.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Houle, G (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",106,35,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,807,"818",NA,"10.2307/176580",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

An alternative method, inspired by earlier work of F. Rohlf and J. Archie, is presented. This Interpoint method is based solely on tree diameter and tree-to-tree distance measurements. A computer performs the necessary triangulation and detects gross errors. The Interpoint method was used to map trees in seven long-term study plots at the Harvard Forest, ranging from 0.25 ha (200 trees) to 0.80 ha (889 trees). The question of accumulation of error was addressed though a computer simulation designed to model field conditions as closely as possible. The simulation showed that the technique is highly accurate and that errors accumulate quite slowly if measurements are made with reasonable care (e.g., average predicted location errors after 1000 trees and after 10 000 trees were 9 cm and 15 cm, respectively, for measurement errors comparable to field conditions; similar values were obtained in an independent survey of one of the field plots). The technique requires only measuring tapes, a computer, and two or three field personnel. Previous field experience is not required. The Interpoint method is a good choice for mapping trees where a high level of accuracy is desired, especially where expensive surveying equipment and trained personnel are not available.","Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA","Boose, ER (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",40,7,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,819,"827",NA,"10.2307/176581",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Annual production and biomass turnover were estimated for the larval chironomid (midge) assemblage found on the submerged woody (snag) habitat of a Coastal Plain blackwater river. Temperature-specific growth rate equations, generated from field growth studies, were applied to the biomass values from quantitative field samples to obtain mean daily production on a monthly basis throughout the year. The most productive genera were the filtering collectors, Rheoranytarsus (31.1 g dry mass.m(-2).yr(-1) for snag surface area) and the gathering collectors, Polypedilum (11.3 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) and Rheocricotopus (9.8 g.m(-2).yr(-1)). Total production was 65.4 g.m(-2).yr(-1) based on summing values of individual taxa, and 69.9 g.m(-2).yr(-1) when applying a family-level equation to biomass of all taxa. When converted to production per square meter of river channel bottom, values were about one-third of the snag surface area estimates (20.1 g.m(-2).yr(-1)). Total chironomid production was somewhat higher in a second sampling year (81.9 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for snag surfaces and 26.8 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for channel bottom). Production was relatively high throughout both years but tended to be lowest in winter with peaks in either summer or fall. These production estimates are among the highest ever reported for chironomids in freshwater systems, primarily owing to extremely high biomass turnover. Annual production/biomass (P/B) values were 158 for Rheocricotopus, 258 for Polypedilum, 196 for Rheotanytarsus, and 202 for total Chironomidae. For Polypedilum, such high annual P/B represents a biomass turnover rate of almost once per day. The P/B values are among the highest estimated for aquatic metazoans (including zooplankton) and are similar to or exceed turnover rates of microbes in many aquatic ecosystems. Such high biomass turnover may be more widespread among freshwater benthic invertebrates than is commonly supposed and may have profound implications for trophic dynamics.","Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Aquat Biol Program, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Benke, AC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Aquat Biol Program, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",114,43,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,899,"910",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0899:PDORCE]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We examined stream fish communities from regions throughout Virginia to assess (1) the relative influence of local vs, regional factors on local species richness, (2) evidence for community saturation, and (3) scale dependency of regional influences. We defined regions at four spatial scales: major drainages, drainage-physiography units, hydrologic-physiography units, and sites. We used multiple regression to identify key correlates of local native and introduced diversity for each regional scale. Both local (e.g., microhabitat diversity) and regional (e.g., species richness) factors were correlated with local diversity; regional diversity was the most consistent correlate. Plots of local vs, regional native diversity were asymptotic for the three largest regional definitions, thereby suggesting community saturation. However, analogous plots for introduced species were not asymptotic; local introduced diversity was a linear function of regional introduced diversity. Introduced populations were pervasive, but less abundant locally than native populations, thereby suggesting that native species are better adapted. Overall, stream fish communities in Virginia appeared to be neither completely saturated nor freely invadable. The ability of regression models and particular independent variables to account for variation in local diversity changed considerably with regional scale. Most regional correlates of local diversity were scale dependent. The concept of hierarchical environmental filters provides a useful framework for integrating the multiple scales over which ecological processes organize communities. Retrospective analyses of the impacts of introduced species on native communities provide some insight regarding community saturation, but conclusive evidence must await studies that couple comparative and experimental approaches. Clear interpretation of regional influences on local diversity will require careful definition of regions. Comparative analyses at multiple regional scales may be the most insightful approach to understanding the complete array of processes that organize communities.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Angermeier, PL (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",203,67,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,911,"927",NA,"10.2307/176589",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Assessment of clonal variation using in gel DNA fingerprinting of gynogens from three drainages indicated that all drainages contained only a single clone. When environments associated with beaver pond succession were pooled across drainages, P. eos was more abundant in active beaver ponds, while gynogens were at higher frequencies in collapsed pond and stream environments. Gynogen frequency for different successional environments classified according to drainage indicated strong variation among drainages, especially in pond environments, but a consistent pattern of increased gynogen frequency in collapsed ponds or streams. Intensive sampling within one drainage across successional beaver pond sites, physical habitats, and gradients of oxygen concentration indicated that P. eos, P. neogaeus, and gynogens were all most abundant in the highly oxygenated littoral environment of an upland pond. P. eos abundance and its relative frequency in the gynogenetic complex decreased, while gynogen frequency increased, in a poorly oxygenated collapsed beaver pond and beaver meadow. Fish transplant experiments revealed that gynogens survived longer and had greater physiological tolerance to oxygen stress than sexual progenitors, especially P. eos. Principal component analysis of 11 growth-related morphometric characteristics revealed morphological intermediacy of the hybrid gynogens between the sexual progenitors, with factors related to trophic morphology, especially mouth width and mouth length, segregating the different forms. A comparison of morphological relationships in a beaver pond with a gynogen frequency of 25-35% to those of a pond with a gynogen frequency of only 6-7% suggested that there was a release in the trophic morphology of P. eos in response to reduced gynogen abundance. The temporal and spatial unpredictability of environmental conditions in the north temperate landscape inhabited by these fish has apparently resulted in selection for a physiologically flexible, general purpose clonal genotype, which occupies a broad ecological niche and may make establishment of additional clones in the same ecosystem difficult.","Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA","Schlosser, IJ (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",53,17,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,953,"968",NA,"10.2307/176592",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We also tested for fragment-size effects by comparing the same measures of demographic performance across three fragment sizes (0.06, 0.25, and 1.0 ha). During 17 censuses between June 1993 and October 1994, we recorded 10 020 captures of 3946 individuals and found strong landscape differences but weak fragment-size effects. Although fragmentation reduced the habitable area by 72%, density and adult recruitment were significantly higher on the fragmented landscape relative to the control. With the exception of adult recruitment (higher on small relative to medium and large patches), no significant demographic differences existed among patches of different size. Low rates of between-population movement and differential juvenile growth rates suggested that higher recruitment rates on the fragmented landscape likely resulted from enhanced local reproduction rather than from immigration. Thus, despite the fact that populations in the fragmented landscape experienced severe habitat loss, some individuals on fragments accrued important reproductive advantages (possibly as a result of diminished social costs or enhanced food resources). That population and individual responses to fragmentation could differ so dramatically provides a novel result that illustrates the importance of using hierarchical field designs in tests of population responses to large-scale habitat alteration. We conclude that controlled, large-scale field tests can serve as an important intermediary between the inherent abstraction of simulation modeling and what is observed in the real world.","Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Boyce, VA 22620 USA; Univ Virginia, Blandy Expt Farm, Boyce, VA 22620 USA","Dooley, JL (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Rt 2,Box 210, Boyce, VA 22620 USA.",78,31,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,969,"980",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0969:DRTHFE]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

It applies the same principles to data in the form of maps as to data in the form of counts at specified locations, but with different techniques. This paper considers data in the form of counts such as occur commonly in ecology. For such data the method has an advantage over traditional approaches that measure only statistical variance heterogeneity, because all the spatial information in the sample is used. Two indices and associated tests are reviewed, one based on the total distance of the sample from a completely regular arrangement, the other from a completely crowded arrangement. A new diagnostic plot is presented to aid interpretation. Results from some artificial data are studied to survey the properties of both indices for defined patterns of clustering. Indices based on the distance to regularity are powerful at detecting aggregation when several clusters are present; those based on the distance to crowding have the power to detect aggregation only when a single cluster is present. Methods are presented to estimate the typical cluster size and intercluster distance, suitable for data from sample units in the form of a contiguous grid.

In most studies, the total number of species recorded in an area at a given time is taken as a measure of species richness. Here we use a capture-recapture approach to species richness estimation with North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data in order to estimate species detectability and thus gain insight about its importance. In particular competing models making different assumptions about species detectability are available. We carried out analyses on all survey routes of four states, Arizona, Maryland, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, in two years, 1970 and 1990. These states were chosen to provide contrasting habitats, bird species composition, and survey quality. We investigated the effect of state, year, and observer ability on the proportions of different models selected, and on estimates of detectability and species richness. Our results indicate that model M-h, which assumes heterogeneous detection probability among species, is frequently appropriate for estimating species richness from BBS data. Species detectability varied among states and was higher for the more skilled observers. These results emphasize the need to take into account potential heterogeneities in detectability among species in studies of factors affecting species richness.","N Carolina State Univ, N Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Inst Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Boulinier, T (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",372,126,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,1018,"1028",NA,"10.2307/176597",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that mutualisms are common. Thus, there appears to be a need for additional theory to describe conditions under which mutualisms may evolve. Furthermore, there is a need for theory to predict the conditions sunder which we expect interactions to remain mutualistic once established. We adopt a biological market approach to present a model for the evolution of resource exchange mutualisms, using the relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi as an example. We apply the economic theory of relative advantage to investigate the conditions under which species ought to specialize and trade. A simple economic analogy demonstrates that, in a two-resource model, a species that is relatively efficient at acquiring one resource would benefit from specialization on acquisition of that resource accompanied by trade for the other resource. The theory of relative advantage extends this prediction to show that specialization and trade confer an advantage even for species that are relatively poor resource competitors for both resources. Under the assumptions of our model, we show that two species ought to specialize in the acquisition of one resource and trade for a second resource as long as each species perceives different relative acquisition costs for the two resources. We also describe the conditions under which changing resource availabilities will benefit, or harm, both partners in a mutualism. We predict conditions conducive to mutualisms to occur when the costs of resource exchange are low, the opportunity to ensure fair trade is high, or the cost of tolerating cheaters is low. Market models such as ours may help to explain the conditionality often observed in mutualisms.","Un iv Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Un iv Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Schwartz, MW (corresponding author), Un iv Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",141,80,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,1029,"1038",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1029:SARTBM]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In their deterministic versions, all models can produce dynamics in the form of a torus, in which there are both short-term cycles and long-term cycles of tens or hundreds of generations. To investigate whether similar long-term patterns can occur when there is environmental variability, we produced stochastic versions of the three models. Long-term population fluctuations occurred over a wider range of parameter values in the stochastic models than in the deterministic models. This suggests that long-term population fluctuations are plausible features of natural tritrophic systems. We use this example to argue that characterizing nonlinearities should not be the sole objective when analyzing stochastic population dynamics. The long-term dynamical patterns produced by our stochastic models can be investigated using linear techniques to quantify the patterns of density dependence in the multispecies system. These techniques identify long-term patterns as near-random-walk dynamics occurring concomitantly with short-term quasi-cyclic dynamics in the three-dimensional three-species system. Interpreting stochastic population dynamics in terms of patterns of density dependence makes it possible to identify the potential for long-term population fluctuations in the absence of very long-term data sets.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Ives, AR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",33,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,1039,"1052",NA,"10.2307/176599",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

However, the ecological processes controlling the spread of hybrid genotypes have rarely been studied in the field. We compared fruit characteristics, fruit preference, and seed dispersal by native frugivores among the non-indigenous succulent Carpobrotus edulis, the putative native congener C. chilensis, and the hybrids resulting from introgressive hybridization. In this system, the non-native C. edulis and hybrids are known to be very successful invaders of California coastal plant communities. Carpobrotus edulis and hybrids produced more fruits per clone than C. chilensis, primarily as a consequence of larger clone size. Clone size and energy content of fruits were good predictors of fruit removal. Marked fruits of C. edulis and hybrids were removed faster than those of the other morphotypes, and C. edulis fruits were preferred over those of C. chilensis in a fruit transplant experiment. However, total fruit removal by the end of the growing season was very high for all morphotypes. Seats from black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the most common frugivores in our sites, contained more seeds from C. edulis and hybrid morphotypes than from C. chilensis, and more than would be expected based on relative fruit abundance. Germination of seeds from C. edulis and hybrids was enhanced after gut passage, whereas germination of C. chilensis decreased after gut passage, compared to seed germination from intact fruits. The results suggest that patterns of fruit preference by native frugivores and seed survival after gut passage facilitate the successful spread of an aggressive introduced species and hybrids in contrast to the less aggressive, apparently native congener.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Vila, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",87,38,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,1053,"1060",NA,"10.2307/176600",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Several parameters influence the magnitude and direction of IGP: feeding specificity, size, mobility, and aggressiveness of the protagonists, as well as extraguild prey density. Under laboratory conditions, we studied IGP among three species of aphid predators, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), Chrysoperla rufilabris (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), and Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which commonly attack the potato aphid (extraguild prey) Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Homoptera: Aphididae). We characterized the levels and symmetry of IGP among the various stages of the predators in the absence of extraguild prey. The aphid specialist A. aphidimyza was more vulnerable to IGP than C. rufilabris and C. maculata, two generalist predators. The C. maculata/A. rufilabris interaction was symmetric (mutual IGP), whereas the C. maculata/A. aphidimyza and C. rufilabris/A. aphidimyza interactions were asymmetric, in favor of the coccinellid and the lacewing, respectively. Sessile and low mobility stages of all species were extremely vulnerable to IGP. Generally, the larger sized individual won confrontations. For similar sizes, lacewing larvae were superior to coccinellid larvae. We also tested whether IGP decreases when extraguild prey are introduced into the system. Data from five predator combinations revealed three types of responses: (1) an exponential decrease in IGP (lacewing instar I vs. coccinellid instar I); (2) a constant IGP (lacewing instar III vs. coccinellid instar I); (3) a constant IGP at low densities decreasing at high densities (lacewing instar III vs. gall midge old larva). Four theoretical scenarios are derived from these responses. Each is discussed according to the ecological attributes of the protagonists. This study shows that IGP is influenced by factors inherent to the predators and external factors such as extraguild prey density. The results are discussed further in the context of aphid biological control.","Univ Laval, Dept Phytol, Ctr Rech Hort, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Lucas, E (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Phytol, Ctr Rech Hort, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",263,78,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,1084,"1092",NA,"10.2307/176603",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Both verbal and mathematical models suggest that host species with higher fitness costs associated with parasitism should bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of parasites. However, few rigorous empirical tests exist. This study examined the effects of a tapeworm parasite (Hymenolepis diminuta) on competition between two flour beetle species (Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum). The flour beetles are the intermediate host of this rat tapeworm parasite. Previous studies demonstrated that T. castaneum is usually the superior competitor in competition with T. confusum in parasite-free environments. However, because T. castaneum is more susceptible to parasitism and shows higher fitness costs when infected than T. confusum, we expected that T. castaneum would bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of the parasite. In contrast, we found that tapeworm infection significantly increased the likelihood of T. castaneum winning the competition, reduced the time needed for T. castaneum to win, and increased T. castaneum population density compared to parasite-free populations. Therefore, our results suggest that the tapeworm infection confers some advantage to T. castaneum and are in contrast to the expectation based on mathematical studies and verbal arguments. Disagreements between experimental results and the hypothesized predictions probably reflect the effect of parasite-induced changes in intraguild predation. Our results suggest that theories on parasite effects of competition need to consider the complex nature of host-parasite associations, including the effect of parasites on host behaviors.","Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Yan, GY (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",29,16,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1998,79,"3",NA,NA,NA,1093,"1103",NA,"10.2307/176604",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We suggest using a technique from the astronomy literature, a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (2DKS) test, to detect relationships in bivariate data with these patterns of variance. This technique successfully identified simulated bivariate data composed of paired independent values as having nonsignificant relationships and simulated bivariate data in which mean and variance of y was constrained at high levels of x as having significant relationships. Using these simulations and examples from aquatic and terrestrial systems, we demonstrate that the 2DKS is a robust test for detecting nonrandom patterns in bivariate distributions that commonly arise in many ecological systems.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Zool, Aquat Ecol Lab, Columbus, OH 43212 USA","Marschall, EA (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Zool, Aquat Ecol Lab, 1314 Kinnear Rd, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.",82,21,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","MAR",1998,79,"2",NA,NA,NA,442,"447",NA,NA,6,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Each is typically illustrated using scatter diagrams with upper and lower boundaries of response variables often changing at different rates with changes in the independent variables, Despite recent statistical contributions that have stimulated an interest in characterizing the limits of a variable, a consensus on an appropriate methodology to quantify the boundaries of scatter diagrams has not yet been achieved, We tested regression techniques based on least squares and least absolute values models using several independent data sets on prey length and predator length for piscivorous fishes and compared estimated slopes for consistency, Our results indicated that least squares regression techniques were particularly sensitive to outlying y values and irregularities in the distribution of observations, and that they frequently produced inconsistent estimates of slope for upper and lower bounds. In contrast, quantile regression techniques based on least absolute values models appeared robust to outlying y values and sparseness within data sets, while providing consistent estimates of upper and lower bound slopes. Moreover, the use of quantile regression eliminated the need for an excess of arbitrary decision-making on the part of the investigator.

Where feasible, accurate characterization of interaction strength can shift the theory of multispecies communities from identifying the vast range of possibilities to isolating the most likely possibilities. To derive generality in our understanding of interaction strengths, however. they must be placed within a unified framework, a framework that can be applied to empirical situations. In this paper we first identify four different theoretical concepts of interaction strength prevalent in the literature (community matrix, Jacobian matrix, inverse Jacobian, and removal matrix), showing how they are related to each other and how they are derived. We also demonstrate that their behavior is not necessarily concordant; hence it is important to identify clearly which concept of interaction strength is being discussed. Then we evaluate several observational and experimental approaches to estimating interaction strength empirically, highlighting their ties to theory, if any, and the limitations and strengths of each approach. Finally, we apply several techniques to a simulated data set, based on an intertidal community, evaluating both accuracy and logistical ease of these approaches. We find that per capita interaction strength is often the most useful index to measure, that caution must be exercised in interpreting empirical estimates of interaction strength because of equilibrium assumptions and the potential confounding effect of indirect effects, and that concentrating on evaluating the relationship between empirically observed rates of change and species abundances may be a profitable way to proceed.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Laska, MS (corresponding author), Laska Ecol Consulting Serv, 200 W 93rd St,Suite 5C, New York, NY 10025 USA.",201,76,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","MAR",1998,79,"2",NA,NA,NA,461,"476",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0461:TCAEAT]2.0.CO;2",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I tested the hypothesis that individual birds exhibit foraging area fidelity. I also investigated evidence for information transfer among birds and the role of tidal cycles in foraging behavior. Flight speed, feeding methods, chick growth rates, and hedging success were similar for radio-tagged birds and birds without radio-tags, suggesting that radio-tags had no significant effect. Birds made an average of two foraging trips per day for 13 d, during a spring and a neap tide series. Twenty-four of 26 birds returned repeatedly ((X) over bar = 19.2 trips) to particular areas to feed; these birds were considered faithful to a foraging area. During spring and neap tides, 17 and 14 birds, repsectively, times their foraging trips to coincide with daily tidal cycles. Foraging area fidelity indicates that kittiwakes learn and remember when and where to forage and therefore may gain local knowledge of their foraging area. Individuals possessing such knowledge may have an advantage over individuals without local knowledge. Foraging area fidelity in individuals indicates that information transfer among colonial seabirds may be less important than previously expected. Birds were selective in joining feeding flocks (13 of 35 flocks were joined). Those that were joined most often were large feeding flocks that occurred in the birds' preferred feeding areas. Birds often fed alone (n = 26 observations) rather than with feeding flocks (n = 9 observations). Individuals of a mated pair did not forage in the same area, suggesting that information transfer regarding foraging did not occur between mates. Some mates were unable to coordinate their tidally timed foraging with nesting activities, and chicks were left unattended, which may have reduced the number of chicks fledged. Such gaps in attendance may reflect why birds such as kittiwakes have delayed maturation and poor reprodctive success during the first few years of breeding.","US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Alaska Fish & Wildlife Res Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Irons, DB (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Alaska Fish & Wildlife Res Ctr, 1011 E Tudor Rd, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA.",162,51,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1998,79,"2",NA,NA,NA,647,"655",NA,"10.2307/176960",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Previous studies have demonstrated that soil nutrient resources become spatially more heterogeneous and are redistributed into islands of fertility with the shift in vegetation. The research presented here addressed the question of whether soil resources become more temporally heterogeneous as well as more spatially heterogeneous when grassland undergoes desertification to form shrubland. Within adjacent grassland and creosotebush sites, soil profiles were described at three soil pits, and samples were collected for description of nutrient resources within the profile. Relative abundance of plant cover and bare soil was determined within each site using line transects. Surface samples (0-20 cm depth) of bare soil and soil beneath the canopies of grasses and creosotebush were collected 17 times during 1992-1994. Soil samples were analyzed for moisture, extractable ammonium and nitrate, nitrogen mineralization potential, microbial biomass carbon, total organic carbon, microbial respiration, dehydrogenase activity, the ratio of microbial C to total organic C (C-mic/C-org), and the ratio of microbial respiration to biomass carbon (metabolic quotient). The major differences in the structure of soils between sites were the apparent loss of 3-5 cm depth of sandy surface soil at the creosotebush site and an associated increase in calcium carbonate content at a more shallow depth. Soils under plants at both sites had greater total and available nutrient resources, with higher concentrations under creosotebush than under grasses. Greatest temporal variation in available soil resources was observed in soils under creosotebush. When expressed on the basis of area, available soil resources were higher in the grassland than in the creosotebush shrubland, primarily due to the difference in plant cover (45% in grassland, 8% in creosotebush shrubland).","New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Biol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Rocky Mt Forest & Range Expt Stn, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; Sandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA","Kieft, TL (corresponding author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Biol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",195,71,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","MAR",1998,79,"2",NA,NA,NA,671,"683",NA,"10.2307/176962",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We monitored flowering, seed production, and seed fall for seven years (1987-1993) for Carpinus laxiflora, C., tschonoskii, C. japonica, and C. cordata, which co occur in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa a Forest Reserve, central Japan. We also monitored the seasonal development of pistillate aments in 1995. These Carpinus species are known to show highly synchronized, fluctuating annual seed production, Total seed production (the sum of sound seeds, reeds suffering predation, empty seeds, and immature seeds) was proportional to the quantity of staminate aments and was synchronized among the four species during the observation period, The percentage of mature seeds (the sum of sound seeds and seeds suffering predation) out of the total seed production was positively correlated with annual staminate ament production. This result supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The observation that most ovaries in this study did not fall after the pollination season and grew into normal, mature-sized seeds irrespective of fertilization (empty or not) also supports the hypothesis. The percentage of seeds suffering predation by insects significantly decreased in relation to sound seed production, suggesting that predator satiation also operated for these Carpinus species, Lf the four species have common seed predators (possibly some curculionid species), mutually synchronized fluctuation of seed production among them would be effective for escaping from pre-dispersal predation.","Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ibaraki, Osaka 305, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 52001, Japan","Shibata, M (corresponding author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, POB 16,Tsukuba Norin Danchi, Ibaraki, Osaka 305, Japan.",75,22,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JAN",1998,79,"1",NA,NA,NA,54,"64",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0054:CACOMS]2.0.CO;2",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We studied regeneration of northern red oak in oak and pine stands on moderately productive sites in northern Lower Michigan, Our objectives were (1) to investigate the hypothesis that regeneration of northern red oak is more successful in pine than in oak stands and (2) to test whether removal of potential overstory and understory competitors increases regeneration success on moderately productive sites. Northern red oak acorns and 2-yr-old nursery seedlings were planted in spring 1991 in three natural oak stands and three red pine (Pinus resinosa) plantations on comparable, moderately productive sites. Each stand contained four canopy cover treatments: clearcut, 25% cover (50% the first year), 75% cover, and uncut. Each canopy cover treatment contained four understory treatments: herb-layer removal, shrub-layer removal, litter removal, and control. Seedling survival, performance, and damage due to deer and late spring frosts were quantified along with vegetation characteristics, light, soil moisture, air temperature, soil temperature, and precipitation during the 1991 and 1992 growing seasons. Survival of seedlings was significantly lower in the pine than in the oak stands; the pine stands had a higher incidence of white-tailed deer browsing and lower levels of belowground resources than the oak stands. Canopy cover treatments produced a gradient from high stress (low light and soil moist-ire) and low disturbance (slight browsing and frost damage) in uncut plots to low stress (high light and soil moisture) and high disturbance (high browsing and frost damage) in clear-cut plots. Understory vegetation development and soil temperature were low in uncut plots, high in clear-cut plots, and intermediate in plots with partial overstory removal. Despite poor growth, the mortality of seedlings planted in uncut plots was low. In contrast, mortality was high and surviving seedlings exhibited good growth in clearcuts. Understory treatment effects were slight compared with overstory treatment effects. Results on our sites (1) do not support the hypothesis that regeneration success of northern red oak may be greater in pine than in oak stands and (2) indicate that the positive effects of removing potential competitors on seedling growth and physiological status may be compromised by simultaneous negative effects of browsing and frost damage.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Forest Expt Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA","Buckley, DS (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Forest Expt Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, 5985 Highway K, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA.",98,60,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JAN",1998,79,"1",NA,NA,NA,65,"78",NA,NA,14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Our primary objective was to test whether complex nonlinear models are necessary to describe dynamics of the Algonquin rodent populations. Variation in abundance among species was related to mean abundance by a simple power function with an exponent of 1.77, implying that population variability did not increase with mean density as much as one might expect for strictly statistical reasons. Time-series analyses of annual population densities indicated no significant autocorrelation functions for five species. Southern red-backed voles, red squirrels, and flying squirrels had significant autocorrelations, but only flying squirrels had an autocorrelation function suggestive of cyclic population dynamics. Per capita rates of population growth were density-dependent in all eight species, although in most cases there was substantial deviation around the fitted regression lines. Response surface models with one- and two-year lags significantly improved the statistical fit to data for three species, but only one of these response surface models was sustainable in the face of realistic stochastic variation in per capita growth. These results suggest that simple logistic models are adequate for predicting the long-term dynamics of the Algonquin small-mammal assemblage.

A variety of ecological factors are expected to affect the shape of this function. Although male gain curves and male allocation patterns have been assayed in a variety of different organisms, there have been few attempts to determine whether the shape of the gain curve changes with ecological conditions. I assayed male gain curves in experimental populations of a colonial ascidian in which I manipulated the intensity of sperm competition to test the hypothesis that gain curves would saturate in the absence of competitors, but remain linear when males competed for fertilizations. Allozyme markers were utilized for paternity assignment. Results supported theoretical predictions, with the gain curve becoming progressively more linear as the intensity of sperm competition increased. Increased levels of sperm competition also had the: effect of decreasing male fertilization success at all sperm production levels. These results have a number of evolutionary implications. First, the existence of a saturating gain curve under some experimental conditions provides support for the hypothesis that diminishing gains in fertilization success via male function may favor the evolution of hermaphroditism. Secondly, the changing shape of this function with ecological conditions suggests that increased allocation to sperm production should be favored in high-density populations, where sperm competition is more intense. Finally, since male fertilization success only continued to increase with sperm production when competitors were present, this suggests that high levels of sperm production in some free-spawning marine invertebrates may be in part due to the selective pressures imposed on allocation patterns by sperm competition.","Univ New Orleans, Dept Biol Sci, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA","Yund, PO (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.",50,13,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JAN",1998,79,"1",NA,NA,NA,328,"339",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0328:TEOSCO]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I use mathematical models to investigate how treatment effects should vary with the size of the area manipulated in open predation experiments, i.e., in studies that allow prey to migrate in and out from experimental units. The most general result is that the influence of prey movements on prey densities decreases with increasing spatial scale of an experiment, while the effect of predation rate is independent of scale. Thus, the results seen in small-scale experiments tend to reflect prey movements, while the effects seen in large-scale experiments are due mainly to predator-related mortality. If predation rates are spatially variable (e.g., the habitat consists of refuge patches and predator-rich patches) the problem becomes mere complex, because movement rates influence predation rates. Movements that are independent of predator density can swamp the effects of predation mortality in small-scale experiments. However; in larger scale experiments, the effect of movements is to increase the predation rate. This is because a larger proportion of the prey is exposed to predators at high movement rates. Predators can also affect local densities through effects on prey behavior. If prey increase movement rates out from predator patches, this will lead to increased treatment effects in small-scale experiments. In contrast, the result of such behaviors is to decrease treatment effects in large-scale experiments, because most prey will be in refuge parches and predation rates will be low. Alternatively, sometimes predators cause prey to decrease activity when close to a predator. This kind of behavioral response leads to decreased treatment effects in small-scale experiments. If the response is strong, the result can even be a reversed effect, i.e., reduced movements out from predator cages lead to increased prey densities in such cages. I argue that the effect of this type of behavior in large-scale experiments should also be to decrease treatment effects. This is because predation rates are usually low on inactive prey. However, freezing behaviors cannot lead to reversed predator effects on a large scale.",NA,"Englund, G (corresponding author), UNIV KENTUCKY,CTR ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,LEXINGTON,KY 40506, USA.",126,31,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1997,78,"8",NA,NA,NA,2316,"2325",NA,NA,10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The native ranges of these two sunfishes are allopatric, except for a small region of overlap in the Carolinas. However, for purposes of sport fishery enhancement, redear have been introduced into many northern lakes where pumpkinseed populations were native. As a result, a large zone of artificial sympatry of pumpkinseed and redear populations has been created in the last decade in lakes of southern Michigan. In this study I examined the feeding performance and diets of co-occurring redear and pumpkinseed both in Michigan lakes and in laboratory studies of these sunfish species from those lakes. Previous research on these species suggests that redear are morphologically and behaviorally more specialized for molluscivory than pumpkinseed, and results from the present study showed that at a given size, the crushing capacity of redear was similar to 2x greater than that of pumpkinseed. For at least the smaller size classes of sunfish, the extent of molluscivory was constrained by crushing strength. Therefore, greater crushing strength of redear allowed them to undergo an ontogenetic niche shift from a diet of predominantly soft-bodied invertebrates to a diet of snails at a smaller size than co-occurring pumpkinseed. Once molluscivorous, redear consumed larger snails than did pumpkinseed. Diet analysis also showed that following their earlier niche shift, redear were significantly more molluscivorous than sympatric pumpkinseed. Summing the effects of greater individual consumption of snails by redear and the effects of a greater proportion of a redear population being molluscivorous due to their earlier niche shift, redear were predicted to be more proficient competitors for snails. It appeared, however, that the superior feeding ability of redear on hard-bodied prey may have come at the cost of reduced efficiency at feeding on soft-bodied invertebrates.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, WK KELLOGG BIOL STN, HICKORY CORNERS, MI 49060 USA; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, HICKORY CORNERS, MI 49060 USA",NA,63,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","DEC",1997,78,"8",NA,NA,NA,2401,"2414",NA,NA,14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Several of these hypotheses have been grouped under a general, ''growth-mortality'' hypothesis, which postulates that larger (a ''bigger-is-better'' mechanism), faster growing (a ''growth-rate'' mechanism), and faster developing (a ''stage-duration'' mechanism) individuals have a higher probability of survival. Using the otolith record of age, size, and ontogeny, these three mechanisms of the ''growth-mortality'' hypothesis were tested for the larval and pelagic juvenile stages of bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (Pisces: Pomatomidae), a moderate-sized, coastal, pelagic, marine fish. Individuals that were larger-at-age were found to have a higher probability of survival, supporting the ''bigger-is-better'' mechanism. Faster growing ing individuals were also found to have a higher probability of survival, agreeing with the prediction of the ''growth-rate'' mechanism. Equivocal evidence was found with regard to the ''stage-duration'' mechanism. These results suggest that in pelagic ecosystems, larger and faster growing larvae have a higher probability of survival. Given the observed directional selection acting on larval size and growth, several potential mechanisms that maintain variable larval size and growth are addressed.

As a secondary objective, we assessed effects of fishes on benthic insects. We used electric ''fences'' to exclude access of fishes to benthic communities in a riffle of a fourth-order stream draining the foothills on Costa Rica's Caribbean slope. Benthic algae and aquatic insects accessible to fishes were subject to intense omnivory by a diverse assemblage of fishes. Over a 7-wk period in the rainy season, three large discharge events occurred in which water levels rose up to 3 m above base flow, discharge increased by up to 160-fold, and suspended gravel and small cobbles caused major scouring. Fishes significantly affected algal succession, community composition, and response to high discharge events. Algal assemblages that developed in the presence of fishes were dominated by filamentous blue-green algae (Lyngbya sp.), whereas diatom assemblages prevailed where fishes were excluded. Fishes significantly reduced numbers of larval Chironomidae (Diptera) and total insects. Algal biovolume was higher and more variable in the absence of fishes than in their presence: significant (P < 0.05) reductions in algal biovolume occurred in the diatom-dominated fish exclusion treatment in response to high discharge. In contrast, in the presence of fishes, algal biovolume increased steadily through time and was not significantly reduced by storms. The third and most severe storm event (39-40 d) resulted in decreases in total algal biovolume, diatom biovolume, algal taxon diversity, and richness in the fish exclusion treatment. However, these parameters increased (despite the storm) in the presence of fishes. Our results show that fishes play a key role in maintaining the stability of benthic algal assemblages and their resistance to storm events. Moreover, results suggest that in the absence of omnivorous fishes, high discharge events would play a major role in structuring benthic algal assemblages, resulting in extreme fluctuations in algal biomass.",NA,"Pringle, CM (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,INST ECOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",98,24,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1997,78,"8",NA,NA,NA,2432,"2442",NA,NA,11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We used aviary and held experiments to study preferences of hummingbirds for unmanipulated flowers and for flowers in which we experimentally dissociated color from nectar reward and morphology. Hummingbirds preferred red flowers of I. aggregata, which contain superior nectar rewards and have relatively broad corolla tubes, relative to flowers of I. tenuituba, which are white, contain small nectar rewards, and have narrow tubes. There was no evidence of flower constancy. When presented with flowers differing only in color, birds showed a spontaneous preference for red. However, this preference could be reversed by making white flowers more rewarding than red. When plants of both parental species and their hybrids were placed in an array in the field, with all flowers painted red, hummingbirds preferred to visit the more rewarding, wider tubed I. aggregata. These results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection could act on color, shape, and nectar separately. Experimental manipulations that dissociate these traits are essential to distinguish direct from correlated selection. Also, hummingbird selection favoring red flowers may result from past experience and, thus, may depend on the ecological context.","UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA; UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE, DEPT BIOL, RIVERSIDE, CA 92521 USA; ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA",NA,133,80,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1997,78,"8",NA,NA,NA,2532,"2541",NA,NA,10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

With males and females treated as separate morphospecies, four trophic characters that relate to killing and feeding behavior and skull length, as a measure of body size, were examined for evidence of morphological patterning, latitudinal size variation, and sexual dimorphism. The competitive basis for character displacement in intra- and interspecific variation in prey size was sought from dietary analysis at a field site. Even spacing in canine strength, but not in other characters, was found among species and sexes of quells (Dasyurus viverrinus and D. maculatus), but not including the devil (Sarcophilus laniarius) or the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), in Tasmania. Even spacing was found in temporalis muscle size for all combinations of the four Tasmanian species. Canine breaking strength and muscle strength driving the canines can be construed as the most important trophic characters involved in prey capture, and therefore in determining the upper size of prey that can be handled. Even spacing was found in Tasmania, where there are two larger species in the guild, but not in any of the three mainland assemblages where the larger species of carnivores have been absent for many generations. The basis for the observed morphological patterning in killing behavior, evidence for even spacing in prey size, and partial character release on the mainland are consistent with the hypothesis of competitive character displacement. These size relationships result from a complex interplay of factors. Latitudinally correlated size variation has influenced an increase in body size and canine strength in D. viverrinus and an increase in body size in D. maculatus in Tasmania. This is countered by decreased canine strength in D. maculatus in Tasmania resulting from competitive character displacement. The result is character convergence.

Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI TECHNOL & MED, CTR POPULAT BIOL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND; BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV, BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES, MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL, IL-84900 SEDE BOQER, ISRAEL","Jones, CG (corresponding author), INST ECOSYST STUDIES, BOX AB, MILLBROOK, NY 12545 USA.",1548,788,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","OCT",1997,78,"7",NA,NA,NA,1946,"1957",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1946:PANEOO]2.0.CO;2",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We present one-and two-species models of sessile organisms incorporating competition for space and two forms of cooperation: habitat amelioration and positive recruitment. In these models, habitat amelioration reduces an organism's mortality rate when it is surrounded by other organisms (''safety-in-numbers''), and positive intraspecific recruitment enables juveniles to use the shelter of established individuals as settlement (or germination) sites. A single-species model incorporating both forms of cooperation may exhibit sharp discontinuities in population density along an environmental gradient. In a two-species model the same mechanisms may lead to sharp boundaries in species composition if, as empirical studies suggest, a trade-off exists between colonization and cooperation abilities (e.g., strong cooperators are poor colonizers).

Yet, the generality of ''edge effects'' has been hotly debated because results vary tremendously. To understand the factors responsible for this variation, we described nest predation and cowbird distribution patterns in forest edge and forest core habitats on 36 randomly selected plots in three states in the midwestern United States. We tested four hypotheses that may explain the variation and mechanisms responsible for edge effects among the 36 plots: (1) the landscape context, (2) the local predator community, (3) the local bird (host-prey) community, and (4) the nest site microhabitat structure. We used artificial nests baited with quail and clay eggs to determine nest predation patterns and predators and used point count surveys to determine cowbird and host abundance in forest edge and forest core habitats. Raccoons, opossums, canids, and birds accounted for most predation of artificial nests. Neither local host abundance nor mean nest concealment of artificial nests significantly influenced nest predation rates in habitat edge or in habitat core. Nest predation was significantly greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in unfragmented landscapes and was significantly higher in edge habitats than in core habitats. However, detection of edge effects varied, depending upon landscape type. Higher predation rates in edge habitats were detected in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes, but not in unfragmented landscapes. Both mammalian and avian predator groups contributed to higher predation rates along edges in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes. Cowbird abundance was significantly related to host abundance, but the effect of hosts varied depending upon habitat type. In edge habitats, cowbird abundance was negatively associated with host abundance in all three landscapes studied. By contrast, cowbird abundance was positively associated with host abundance in core habitats. Once the effects of host abundance were removed, cowbird abundance in core habitat was greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in moderately and unfragmented landscapes, but did not differ between the latter two. In edge habitat, cowbird abundance did not differ between landscapes, but abundance in edges tended to be highest in the highly fragmented landscape and lowest in the unfragmented landscape. Cowbird abundance did not vary between edge and core habitat in any of the landscapes studied. We suggest that the first approximation to predicting the impact of agricultural or permanently managed edges on forest songbird reproductive success is to assess habitat characteristics at the landscape scale. Given geographic location, local factors such as host abundance and predator composition should be assessed.","UNIV MISSOURI,N CENT FOREST EXPT STN,USDA,FOREST SERV,COLUMBIA,MO 65211; UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE,COLUMBIA,MO 65211",NA,463,141,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1997,78,"7",NA,NA,NA,2064,"2075",NA,"10.2307/2265945",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Total enemy-induced mortality is higher in the late developmental stages, and overall, parasitoids kill more herbivores than do either predators or pathogens. Among the ecological variables, both feeding biology and latitude showed significant enemy effects in at least one late developmental stage, whereas neither cultivation status nor invasion status was associated with enemy-induced mortality in any stage. Bonferroni adjustment of probabilities for multiple comparisons resulted in few significant interactions between enemy type and the ecological variables. However, raw probabilities and comparisons across herbivore immature stages suggest several patterns that deserve attention in future studies: (1)endophytic herbivores suffer lower mortality by predators and pathogens than exophytics, and endophytic leaf miners suffer the greatest parasitoid-induced mortality, while endophytic gallers/borers/root feeders suffer the least; (2) overall enemy-induced mortality is similar in natural and cultivated habitats; (3) exotic insects do not suffer lower enemy-induced mortality rates than natives; and (4) predation and disease may be greater in tropical/subtropical habitats, whereas parasitism is greater in the temperate zone.

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre-and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","Kohler, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY,CTR AQUAT ECOL,CHAMPAIGN,IL 61820, USA.",112,42,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1997,78,"7",NA,NA,NA,2164,"2176",NA,"10.2307/2265953",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Additionally, it is unclear how much variation in plastic responses exists among individuals, populations, and species, and thus how much potential there is for natural selection to act on coral reaction norms. In the branching coral Madracis mirabilis, corallite architecture and density, branch diameter and spacing, and overall aggregate morphology all vary among environments. To examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in generating these patterns, clonal replicates of five genotypes of M. mirabilis were transplanted from each of two source populations into four treatment environments on the north coast of Jamaica. Flow rate, sedimentation, irradiance, water temperature, and salinity all varied among these environments. DNA fingerprinting was used to ensure that the 10 transplanted genotypes were genetically distinct. Six morphological traits (intersepta area, septa length, columella area, corallite area, corallite spacing, and branch tip diameter) were measured after transplantation to determine whether they were altered in response to environmental conditions. Because these traits were correlated, principal components analysis was used to define new, uncorrelated traits for analysis. Four of the five corallite traits and branch diameter were significantly affected by the environment, demonstrating that morphological variation among environments in M. mirabilis is due in large part to phenotypic plasticity. No difference was detected between the two source populations in the magnitude or direction of their plastic responses, but there was substantial variation among genotypes (genotype x environment interaction). Many of the phenotypic changes of both populations resulted in the transplants becoming morphologically similar to resident conspecifics in each treatment environment. Genotypes from both populations were able to maintain similar growth rates under diverse environmental conditions. Such morphological convergence by phenotypic plasticity may expand the ecological range of this species by enabling genotypes to tolerate spatially and temporally variable environments.","CALIF STATE UNIV NORTHRIDGE, DEPT BIOL, NORTHRIDGE, CA 91330 USA",NA,145,30,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1997,78,"7",NA,NA,NA,2177,"2190",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2177:CVFPPI]2.0.CO;2",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Anolis lizards have radiated extensively in the West Indies, as well as mainland Central and South America. In the Caribbean, similar communities of anole species specialized for different habitats (ecomorphs) have evolved independently on each Greater Antillean island. We examined ecological and morphological data on 49 Anolis species (33 Caribbean, 16 mainland) to investigate whether the same set of ecomorphs has arisen in mainland regions. More generally, we investigated whether the relationship between ecology and morphology was similar among anoles in the two regions. Radiations in the two regions are very different. The majority of mainland anole species exhibit morphological characteristics unlike any Caribbean ecomorph. Furthermore, relationships between ecology and morphology are very different between the two sets of anole species. Among mainland anole species, toepad size is positively correlated with perch height, whereas tail length is negatively related to perch diameter. In contrast, among Caribbean anole species, both forelimb length and body mass are positively associated with perch diameter, and both tail length and hindlimb length are negatively related to perch diameter. Biomechanical considerations provide a functional basis for some of these correlations, but much variation remains to be explained.

Across six topographically diverse sites, grazers increased delta(15)N Of soil (0-20 cm) by 0.7 parts per thousand, which was substantial considering that values for ungrazed soil ranged 2.4 parts per thousand (2.4-4.8 parts per thousand). The magnitude of grazer N-15 enrichment was positively related (r(2) = 0.70) to the intensity of herbivore activity during the study, indexed by the amount of dung (g/m(2)) deposited at the sites. We also found that soil delta(15)N Of ungulate urine and dung patches was significantly higher than that of control areas. Grazers probably increased soil delta(15)N by promoting N loss from the soil via leaching, ammonia volatilization, and/or denitrification. Each of these processes results in the removal of N-15 depleted products from the soil and, consequently, N-15 enrichment of the remaining soil. In contrast to soil results, grazers reduced plant N-15 by an average of 0.7 parts per thousand, probably due to isotopically light, soil NO3-(compared to soil NH4+) constituting a more important N source for plants in grazed grassland relative to those in ungrazed grassland. These findings indicate that native grazers increased N loss from this north-temperate grassland as a result of accelerated losses on urine-and dung-affected microsites and, potentially, from elevated N loss throughout the grazed landscape due to grazers promoting N cycling. Furthermore, these results suggest that herbivores increase plant NO3-assimilation, which may positively affect primary productivity in this grazed ecosystem.","UNIV ARKANSAS,FAYETTEVILLE,AR 72701","Frank, DA (corresponding author), SYRACUSE UNIV,BIOL RES LABS,SYRACUSE,NY 13244, USA.",215,101,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1997,78,"7",NA,NA,NA,2238,"2248",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2238:EONGOG]2.0.CO;2",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Using a case study from my own work on the pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators of two members of the Polemoniaceae, Polemonium foliosissimum and Ipomopsis aggregata, I show that the outcome of selective pressures is not always predictable by examining one group of organisms or another. In addition, the outcome of separate and combined selective pressures is variable among years. Thus I show that only by considering all organisms that affect the fitness of a plant may we gain a complete understanding of the evolution of floral traits. I argue that we must account for both geographical and temporal variation in assessing the ecological and evolutionary importance of interacting organisms.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,CRESTED BUTTE,CO 81224","Brody, AK (corresponding author), UNIV VERMONT,DEPT BIOL,BURLINGTON,VT 05405, USA.",192,97,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1997,78,"6",NA,NA,NA,1624,"1631",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1624:EOPHAS]2.0.CO;2",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We conclude that natural levels of variation in herbivory and other environmental factors during pollen development are often sufficient to cause significant differences in pollen performance, and that the differences in pollen performance are likely to be caused by differences in the provisioning of pollen grains. From an evolutionary perspective, we discuss how pollen and ovule provisioning may be negatively genetically correlated and how this would maintain genetic variation for pollen performance within populations. Furthermore, the highly plastic nature of pollen performance provides the potential for genotypes to respond differently to environmental variation (genotype-environment interactions), which would also promote the maintenance of genetic variation in pollen performance.","PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA","Delph, LF (corresponding author), INDIANA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA.",181,56,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","SEP",1997,78,"6",NA,NA,NA,1632,"1639",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1632:HEFAPP]2.0.CO;2",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This rarity could be due to high cost of pollination, phylogenetic constraints, alternative life history shifts to reduce or avoid risk of seed nondevelopment, or ecological factors such as co-pollinators that can satiate pollen requirements and mask variation in pollinator effectiveness among ovipositing seed eaters. Ecological costs of being a pollinator were measured for a yucca moth species and were found to be low: active time allocated to pollen pickup and deposit was on average 4.1%, an average of 0.42% of female body mass was allocated to specific structures for pollen manipulation, and the average pollen load weighed <4% of moth body mass. These estimates suggest that ecological costs need not be a major obstacle to evolution of active pollination. In contrast, recent combined ecological-phylogenetic analyses for the yucca moth family suggest that the evolution of active pollination and transition to mutualism depended largely on preadaptations, and that few traits were truly novel. If general, active pollination would be predicted to be likely to evolve only in lineages with life histories that facilitate mutualism. Alternative outcomes to evolution of active pollination include delayed oviposition, detection of floral pollination status, egg placement that allows the larva to select a fruit, and modified egg dispersion strategies to balance the cost of pollination. The historical significance of these factors can be assessed only when mechanisms are documented in many lineages and analyzed in a phylogenetic framework. Active fungal inoculation among arthropods is ecologically analogous to active pollination, and offers a complement for comparative analyses. Specific structures for spore transport have evolved many times in at least three orders of insects, and several times in mites. The large number of independent lineages of active pollen and fungus dispersers jointly provide a platform for testing hypotheses about, e.g., the role of preadaptations in evolution of mutualism, reversals of mutualism, and the role of mutualism in diversification.",NA,"Pellmyr, O (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BOX 1812 STN B,NASHVILLE,TN 37212, USA.",63,31,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1997,78,"6",NA,NA,NA,1655,"1660",NA,NA,6,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This procedure generated detailed hypotheses about the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and pollination systems. These hypotheses were tested using the results of chemical analyses and bioassays of foliar and floral secretions. Multiple lines of defense appear to have evolved in sequence in Dalechampia. The first defense system to originate was deployment of triterpene resins to defend the staminate flowers, This feature was a preaptation (preadaptation) that allowed the evolution of a resin-based, pollinator-reward system. Thus pollination by resin-collecting bees originated as a ''transfer exaptation'' (a new function replaced the old). This hypothesis is supported by anti-herbivore activities of floral resins and by chemical similarity of floral defense and reward resins. After the resin defense of flowers was lost by conversion into a reward system, there followed (in evolutionary time) a sequence of defensive innovations. These included nocturnal closure of large, involucral bracts to protect both staminate and pistillate flowers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the large bracts themselves probably originated as a floral advertisement system, and the bracts assumed a defensive function through ''addition exaptation'' (a new function was added to the old). Additional lines of defense to evolve were deployment of resin to defend the developing ovaries and seeds (an addition exaptation), deployment of sharp, detaching trichomes on enveloping sepals to defend developing seeds (apparent adaptations), closure of involucral bracts around the developing fruits and seeds (an addition exaptation), and deployment of resin to defend the leaves and growing shoot tips (also an addition exaptation). Support for this scenario also derives from the chemical similarities of sepal, foliar, and floral resins, and the anti-herbivore properties of foliar resins. It appears that at least one pollinator-reward system originated by modification of a defense system, and several defense systems originated by modification of pollinator reward and advertisement systems. Thus exaptations have been important in the origin of new defense and pollination systems, and each system has significantly influenced the evolution of the other on several occasions.","UNIV ALASKA,INST ARCTIC BIOL,FAIRBANKS,AK 99775","Armbruster, WS (corresponding author), NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT BOT,N-7055 DRAGVOLL,NORWAY.",143,60,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1997,78,"6",NA,NA,NA,1661,"1672",NA,NA,12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

It is striking that the evolution of resistance by target pest species in biological control is much less frequently reported, particularly in control involving parasitoids and predators, rather than pathogens. Although it is conceivable that this reflects biases in reporting or frequency of application, we suggest that there is a puzzle here worthy of scrutiny, and we outline several potential underlying causes. In order of discussion (not necessarily of importance), these are: (1) lack of genetic variation; (2) genetic constraints on selection; (3) weak selection; (4) temporally varying selection; and (5) coevolutionary dynamics. We, in particular, focus on the potential for weak selection on the host for increased resistance, despite effective control. The very spatial mechanisms (e.g., refuges, metapopulation dynamics) believed to facilitate the persistence of many natural enemy-victim systems with strong biological control may also incidentally provide an environment where selection is weak on target pests to evolve improved resistance to control agents, thereby biasing coevolution toward the enemy. The basic insight is that in a spatially heterogeneous environment, a strong limiting factor on a population can be a weak selective factor. The hypotheses presented here provide ingredients needed to predict which biological control systems might be evolutionarily stable, and which not.

To investigate these potential interactions, we performed a factorial combination of clipping treatments, fertilizer additions, and hand pollinations in a natural population of scarlet gilia in 1994 and 1995. Clipping imposed the strongest treatment effect on plants and acted by delaying phenology, altering plant architecture, and reducing plant fitness in both years. Hand pollinations increased the production of fruits and seeds in 1995 only, suggesting that our population was pollen limited in that year. Clipped plants could compensate for damage, but only under a restrictive set of environmental conditions, including fertilizer and hand pollinations in 1994, and hand pollinations in 1995. We did not detect significant overcompensation in either year of study, even under conditions releasing plants from nutrient and pollen limitation. A phenotypic selection analysis was conducted in 1995 to investigate several traits thought to influence fitness in the presence and absence of herbivore damage. Clipped plants were under strong selection for early flowering and increased plant height. We did not detect a significant association between branch production or plant size and fitness in grazed plants, suggesting that other factors determined the ability of plants to compensate for damage in 1995. We suggest that clipping-induced changes in plant architecture and phenology altered interactions between damaged plants and pollinators. We offer several hypotheses to explain these patterns and highlight the complexity of pollinator-and herbivore-mediated selection in natural plant populations.","UNIV COLORADO,MT RES STN,NEDERLAND,CO 80466","Juenger, T (corresponding author), UNIV CHICAGO,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL,1101 E 57TH ST,CHICAGO,IL 60637, USA.",119,45,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1997,78,"6",NA,NA,NA,1684,"1695",NA,NA,12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

(2) In an experiment conducted in mesocosms, food distribution, predator presence, thermal heterogeneity, and kinship all interacted to influence tadpole dispersion. (3) In a field experiment conducted in natural ponds, kinship significantly influenced group size at artificially established food patches. (4) In a field enclosure experiment, density, access to the substrate, and kinship all interacted to significantly influence growth and survivorship of tadpoles. Subsequent analysis revealed that kinship affected the distribution of individual tadpole body size: mass was more skewed (i.e., more small individuals) in groups of mixed relatedness than in kin groups. The interaction among kinship, density, and substrate factors resulted in context-dependent effects on tadpole size distribution and survivorship. Our results demonstrate that kinship factors can influence competitive interactions between tadpoles depending upon the ecological conditions, and they provide a functional explanation for kin-discriminating behavior observed in tadpoles of R. cascadae.

In this paper we examine if and how soil-borne pathogens may play a role in plant competition. As a model, two successional plant species from coastal sand dunes were used: Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) and Festuca rubra sap. arenaria (sand fescue). The root zone of A. arenaria contains pathogens that contribute to the degeneration of their host when dunes become stabilized. These pathogens (plant parasitic nematodes and pathogenic fungi) are relatively harmless to the immediate successor F. rubra. We tested the hypothesis that F. rubra, when gown in a mixed culture with A. arenaria, will be favored when A. arenaria is exposed to soil-borne pathogens from its own root zone. In a greenhouse, seedlings of both species were grown in replacement series in sterilized (pathogen-free) and unsterilized (pathogen-containing) soils originating from the root zone of natural A. arenaria. Nutrient additions, soil moisture, and the length of the experiment were based on two pilot studies. When exposed to its soil-borne pathogens, A. arenaria was outcompeted, especially when it constituted <50% of the planted mixture. Nutrient limitation enhanced the replacement of A. arenaria by F. rubra especially in unsterilized soil. This was due to reduced plasticity of A. arenaria in responding to nutrient limitation when exposed to its pathogens.

A high frequency of diagnostic tree rings (light rings and narrow rings) allowed the cross-dating of 142 individuals and the construction of a master chronology spanning AD 690-1591. Three floating chronologies covering 964 (approximate to 178 BC-AD 785), 349 (approximate to 587-239 BC) and 210 (approximate to 1274-1065 BC) years were also developed. The buried stems were classified as arborescent (75%), small fragments of unknown origin (13%), stumps (11%), and portions of stunted stems (1%). The high frequency of arborescent individuals indicates that the buried spruces were the remains of a former forest. The forest bordered the peatland between 600 BC and AD 1568, and successfully regenerated after two fires around 350 BC and 10 BC. Winter-damaged trees dominated during periods of suppressed growth at AD 760-860 and AD 1025-1400, whereas undamaged trees were more frequent during periods of rapid growth around AD 700-750, 860-1000, 1400-1450, and 1500-1570. Fast growth between AD 860-1000, along with the concurrent establishment of symmetrical trees, suggests well-defined boundaries for the Medieval Warm Period in northeastern Canada. The forest abruptly shifted to an open krummholz (stunted spruce) after the last fire in AD 1568, indicating that a climatic threshold inhibiting postfire regeneration was crossed between the second and the last fires. The maintenance of this old growth forest over 1500 yr, in the absence of external disturbances except climate change, was probably due to the buffering effect of aggregated trees on wind-drifted conditions at the snowpack line. With the exclusion of the forest influence on microclimate and local growth conditions, the AD 1568 fire caused the forest vegetation to shift to krummholz. The amplitude of these ecosystem changes at tree line does not mirror that of climate change. Hence, it is concluded that climate and vegetation reconstructions from proxy indicators cannot portray full ecological impact, because vegetation change at tree line is nonlinear relative to climate change.","UNIV LAVAL,CTR ETUD NORD,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA",NA,55,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1997,78,"6",NA,NA,NA,1873,"1883",NA,NA,11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Correlations of control variables such as climatic factors and response variables such as vegetation and soil carbon storage across broad regions have played a crucial role in predicting the response of ecosystems to global climate change. Despite the importance of these large-scale space-for-time substitutions, there are substantial limitations. One of these limitations is that many of the possible control factors covary with one another, and only some of the important control factors actually exist in large-scale databases. Thus, the true proximal controls may be difficult to identify. A second limitation is that models of spatial variability may not be appropriately applied to temporal variability. In this paper, we utilize a new approach to determine the extent to which N availability may constrain aboveground primary productivity in the Central Grassland region of the U.S. The strong relationship between average annual primary production and average annual precipitation found in spatial patterns in ecosystems globally has often been interpreted as evidence of a fundamental water limitation. However, temporal variation in annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) indicates that other factors constrain production. We generated a spatial and temporal database for annual aboveground net primary production and annual net N mineralization by linking a database of input variables (precipitation, temperature, and soils) with predictive models. We generated independent data sets of aboveground net primary production and net N mineralization by using regression models to predict aboveground net primary production, and the Century model to simulate net N mineralization. Our analyses indicate that net primary production and net N mineralization both increase with mean annual precipitation; thus, it is not possible to separate the extent to which ANPP is controlled by water or N availability. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increased with increasing precipitation across the region. Aboveground net primary production decreased with increasing temperature across the region, while N mineralization increased slightly, leading to decreasing (NUE) with increasing temperature. At high precipitation levels, aboveground net primary production increased and N mineralization decreased slightly with increasing soil fineness. Nitrogen use efficiency generally increased with increasing pools of soil organic matter, likely because in grasslands, the proportion of recalcitrant organic matter increases with the total organic matter pools. A comparison of interannual variation in net N mineralization with average spatial variation indicated a high degree of inertia in the response of N availability to precipitation levels. Our simulation results as well as field results of Lauenroth and Sala (1992) raise important questions about the applicability of space-for-time substitutions when dealing with ecosystem function.

The keystone predator hypothesis maintains that intense predation by one consumer species is necessary to prevent a prolific, competitively dominant prey species from eliminating-other species using the same resource. This study considers the consequences of extreme spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of a prey species supporting keystone and diffuse predation. Prior experiments on rocky shores of Santa Catalina Island, California, USA, demonstrated that predation by spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) maintained a distinctive red algal turf by killing juvenile mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis) that otherwise overgrow and replace the algae. In the present study, long-term surveys revealed that high recruitment of the predominant mussel, M. californianus occurred only on the most wave-exposed sites in certain years; mussel recruitment was slight to nil on relatively protected sites in most years. A predator exclosure experiment consisting of seven replicates placed along the gradient of wave exposure demonstrated that the effects of predation depended upon the spatial differences in recruitment rates. Lobsters on wave-exposed sites functioned as keystone predators; on more sheltered sites, little or no predation, whether by lobsters or the fishes and whelks also foraging on the sheltered sites, was necessary to maintain the algal assemblage. Similar species assemblages can be maintained by markedly different relative levels of crucial ecological rates. In the mid-intertidal zone of Santa Catalina Island, the intense species interactions depicted in the keystone predator hypothesis occurred only at productive, high wave exposure locations; low recruitment of mussels elsewhere preempts both predation and the competition between the mussel and algal assemblages. Thus, red algae dominates rocky shores through different mechanisms over a range of physical conditions. The occurrences of low mussel recruitment do not appear to be anomalies, but rather a consequence of the life history of Mytilus californianus.",NA,"Robles, CD (corresponding author), CALIF STATE UNIV LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA 90032, USA.",64,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1997,78,"5",NA,NA,NA,1400,"1414",NA,NA,15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Birds were censused on all islands and at mainland control sites by spot mapping in 1993, and via point counts in 1995. Instead of orderly ''nested sets'' of species on landmasses of graded size, the species composition of small (approximate to 1 ha) and medium (11-12 ha) islands was highly variable. Spot mapping substantiated the occurrence of 58 species of forest-nesting birds, collectively, on the 11 small and medium islands, which supported means of only 9 and 12 resident species, respectively. No species was found on all islands, and only five species were found on as many as 7 of the 11 small and medium islands. The mean number of islands per resident species was 3.0 for the 11 islands. Transients of many species were detected on all islands, but were more frequent on near (less than or equal to 0.5 km from a larger landmass) than on far islands (greater than or equal to 1.0 km from a larger landmass). A large majority of the populations on the 1-ha islands consisted of a single pair, implying that few such populations could have survived since isolation without new colonizations to replenish individuals lost to dispersal and mortality. Notwithstanding low species numbers, both census methods indicated that avian densities were approximately twice as high on the 1-ha islands as on the mainland. In contrast, two of three medium-sized islands supported anomalously low densities of approximately one-fifth the mainland level. Both islands retain relict populations of capuchin monkeys (Cebus olivaceus). One hundred percent of artificial nests set out on one of these islands were raided, whereas no more than 30% of nests were lost on any of the other islands or on the mainland. For small and medium islands, we conclude that the founding communities present when the waters of Lago Curl reached their final level have already collapsed and been reconstituted. Species loss on some islands may have been accelerated by relict populations of predators, such as capuchins. Changes in composition thus appear to have been driven by a combination of biological (nest predation) and stochastic processes (high turnover).","UNIV NACL AGR LA MOLINA,DEPT ZOOL,LIMA,PERU; UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT BIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63121","Terborgh, J (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,CTR TROP CONSERVAT,3705-C ERWIN RD,DURHAM,NC 27705, USA.",84,38,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1997,78,"5",NA,NA,NA,1494,"1501",NA,NA,8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We analyzed data collected throughout an area of 40 x 10(6) km(2) of open ocean over 10 years (1979-1988) during 1136 at-sea days, from 1750 feeding flocks comprising 51 688 birds of 49 species. a PCA identified three distinct hock types based on species composition: ''Sooty Tern Flocks'' (n = 941 flocks) with a large number of Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata), ''Juan-Wedge Flocks'' (n = 402 flocks) with a large number of Juan Fernandez Petrels (Pterodroma externa) and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), and ''Booby Flocks'' (n = 407 flocks) with a large number of Red-footed and Masked Boobies (Sula sula and S. dactylatra, respectively). Flock types exhibited largely disjunct distributions that mirrored patterns in thermocline depth and surface water chlorophyll content. Sooty Tern Flocks occurred in areas with deepest thermocline (77.6 m) and lowest chlorophyll (0.14 mg/m(3)), Juan-Wedge Flocks in areas of intermediate thermocline (68.8 m) and chlorophyll (0.16 mg/m(3)), and Booby Flocks in areas of shallowest thermocline (62.5 m) and highest chlorophyll (0.17 mg/m(3)). These differences were statistically significant. As thermocline depth and surface water chlorophyll are reliable indicators of surface water productivity, we conclude that Sooty Tern Flocks foraged in waters of low productivity, Juan-Wedge Flocks in waters of intermediate productivity, and Booby Flocks in waters of highest productivity. Differences in published cost-of-flight values support the hypothesis that energetic constraint determines flock structure at the low-productivity end of the system. Sooty Terns have the lowest flight costs (4.8 W) and feed in waters of lowest productivity. Flight costs are progressively higher for those species feeding in more productive waters (9.9 W for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, 19.0 W for Red-footed Boobies). Differences in body size support the hypothesis that interference competition determines hock structure at the high-productivity end of the system. The largest species, Masked Boobies (1987 g) and Red-footed Boobies (1003 g), feed in areas of highest productivity; progressively smaller species, Juan Fernandez Petrels (430 g) and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (388 g), and Sooty Terns (180 g), feed in areas of decreasing productivity. We hypothesize that this community is largely structured by two factors, competition and energetic constraint, that operate at opposite ends of a productivity gradient. As productivity decreases (low prey abundance), flight proficiency is increasingly important because only species with relatively low flight costs will be able to transit between prey patches. As productivity increases (high prey abundance), competitive ability is increasingly important because competitive dominants will exclude other species from feeding flocks. Our hypothesis is in accordance with empirical data and theoretical models designed to explain factors structuring communities for a wide variety of habitats and taxa.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES, DEPT BIOL, LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 USA","Ballance, LT (corresponding author), SW FISHERIES SCI CTR, 8604 LA JOLLA SHORES DR, LA JOLLA, CA 92037 USA.",186,47,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUL",1997,78,"5",NA,NA,NA,1502,"1518",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1502:SCSAAP]2.0.CO;2",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Major differences in water calcium levels were observed in correlation with lithological differences (average 13.6 mg/L in the crystalline massif of the Belledonne and 83.4 mg/L in the limestone areas of the Chartreuse and Vercors). The comparative analysis of the populations was performed through field and laboratory experimentation at morphometrical and ecophysiological levels. Uniform samples of male adult specimens from six different sites (two sites in the Belledonne, two sites in the Chartreuse, and two sites in the Vercors) were compared using three easily measurable parameters: maximum dry mass, duration of the molt cycle, and calcium balance during the molt cycle. Animals from waters that flow over limestone show a larger maximum size and a longer molt cycle than those from waters that flow over crystalline rocks. Spectrophotometrical analysis of their calcium balance during the molt cycle reveals that, whereas all animals are equally calcified during the intermolt, the decalcification during the premolt and the recalcification during the postmolt are more rapid in animals from limestone areas than in those from crystalline sites. Translocation experiments in both natural and artificially calcium-enriched waters confirm these differences. A significant increase in the duration of the molt cycle was observed in animals translocated to water of lower calcium concentration and vice versa, whereas no significant difference was observed between controls and animals translocated into water of comparable calcium concentration. Current results, supported by such a new synthetic experimental approach, indicate that variations in water calcium levels may generate important ecophysiological differentiation between populations, which may suggest a possible influence of environmental calcium on the geographic distribution of Gammarus fossarum.",NA,"Meyran, JC (corresponding author), UNIV GRENOBLE 1,CNRS UMR 5553,LAB BIOL POPULAT ALTITUDE,BP 53,F-38041 GRENOBLE 9,FRANCE.",12,4,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1997,78,"5",NA,NA,NA,1579,"1587",NA,NA,9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The occurrence of additional generations within one year can have a profound effect on the ecology and evolution of a species. Most previous studies of the cues that induce facultative diapause in insects have concentrated on photoperiod and temperature. In contrast, we studied the effects of host-plant quality on the induction of larval diapause and subsequent voltinism in a poryphagous insect herbivore, Choristoneura rosaceana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Field experiments demonstrated that the proportion of larvae entering diapause differed among four host-plant species. Larvae feeding on chokecherry were more likely to continue development and produce a second generation than larvae feeding on red maple or black ash. Paper birch was intermediate in diapause induction. Laboratory experiments with excised foliage supported the results of the field experiments and demonstrated that the induction of diapause depended on host species under constant conditions of photoperiod and temperature. A further study with low- and high-quality artificial diet demonstrated that the nutritional quality of larval diet has a direct effect on diapause induction: low-quality diet favored diapause induction. Dispersal of neonate larvae from host foliage did not necessarily reflect host quality and the potential for bivoltinism. We argue that the effect of plant quality on diapause induction in natural populations of insect herbivores merits more attention.","UNIV LAVAL,DEPT BIOL,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA",NA,143,44,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1997,78,"4",NA,NA,NA,977,"986",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0977:HPQIDA]2.0.CO;2",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The effects of both flow speed and prey density on the feeding rates of coral reef dwelling planktivorous fish were examined under controlled laboratory conditions. Fish placed inside a large recirculating flow chamber exhibited a limited enhancement of feeding rates following the increase of flow speed from 3 to 18 cm/s. Feeding rates peaked between 6 and 12 cm/s and appeared to decline upon subsequent increases in speed. Saturation of feeding rates did not correspond directly with prey flux, as higher rates were achieved at ''higher prey density-lower flow speed'' treatments of equal flux. Video analysis of fish movements while foraging, together with experimentation involving fish feeding under restricted spatial conditions, indicated the narrowing of the fishes' reactive volume with increasing flow speed. The dependence of reactive volume size on flow speed was incorporated into the Holling disk equation and shown to reproduce much of the observed trends. Disparities between the observed and predicted dependence of feeding rates on flow speed suggest additional effects of flow speed on search efficiency parameters, such as prey detectability and capture success.","H STEINITZ MARINE BIOL LAB,IL-88103 ELAT,ISRAEL; HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,DEPT EVOLUT SYSTEMAT & ECOL,JERUSALEM,ISRAEL",NA,38,17,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1997,78,"4",NA,NA,NA,1062,"1077",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1062:PFMATF]2.0.CO;2",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Water pythons (Liasis fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain in tropical Australia prey almost exclusively on dusky rats (Rattus colletti). Rat numbers varied dramatically among years of the study. Feeding rates of pythons were highest when rats were abundant, and the snakes were in good condition (mass relative to body length) at these times. The proportion of adult female pythons that reproduced in a given year was also tightly linked to rat abundances. However, reproductive output per litter (offspring size, and fecundity relative to maternal body size) was unaffected by prey availability, perhaps because of high fecundity-independent costs of reproduction. Instead, female pythons reproducing in ''good'' years were in better condition after oviposition. These data support an energy-limitation model for snake reproduction, whereby prey availability determines predator reproductive output, but the relationship between the two variables is complex. The degree to which prey availability influences feeding rates of pythons and the degree to which feeding rates influence body condition depend crucially on snake body size (due to size-related shifts in foraging abilities and metabolic costs). Thus, a given prey abundance translates into different energy reserves for different-sized predators. Also, females delay reproduction until they can gain enough energy for a large clutch of eggs, and reproductive output per litter does not then increase with additional energy availability. Such nonlinearities in predator responses to prey availability may be widespread.",NA,"Shine, R (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY, SCH BIOL SCI A08, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA.",114,17,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1997,78,"4",NA,NA,NA,1078,"1086",NA,"10.2307/2265859",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator-prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata, and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal communities.",NA,"Peacor, SD (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,NAT SCI BLDG,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",183,65,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1997,78,"4",NA,NA,NA,1146,"1156",NA,"10.2307/2265865",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In contrast, estimation of plant population size has usually been assumed to be much easier. However, detection of individuals is difficult for perennial plants, such as the rare prairie plant Mead's milkweed (Asclepias meadii), which does not produce aboveground parts every year and lives in dense vegetation where nonflowering stems are hard to observe. In these cases, a count of the number of plants observed in a particular year may greatly underestimate the true population size, just as a count of animals in traps does not adequately estimate the total number of animals in an area. Using a family of closed population models (CAPTURE), we applied mark-recapture methodology to estimate population size of A. meadii. Over a 4-yr period, a total of 129 patches (aggregated collections of stems) was observed, with 124 flowering in at least one year. In any one year, however, the number of flowering patches ranged from 15 to 105. Using model M-th of CAPTURE with these data, the estimated number of patches capable of flowering was 219.

When groups of mantids were raised in the laboratory, mortality declined with increased food, owing to decreased starvation. Cannibalism in these cohorts did not differ between food levels. Therefore, greater mortality at higher food levels probably was not caused by intraspecific interactions.

We compared the results of parametric confidence limits and homogeneity statistics commonly obtained through meta-analysis to those obtained from resampling methods to ascertain the robustness of standard meta-analytic techniques.

The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.",NA,"Neubert, MG (corresponding author), WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT BIOL, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.",242,83,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","APR",1997,78,"3",NA,NA,NA,653,"665",NA,NA,13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Tree-ring and growth-form patterns of cross-dated black spruce (Picea mariana) remains in peat were used to analyze stand responses in two contrasting topographical settings: a moderately protected valley-bottom peatland, and an exposed hilltop peatland. Dense, old-growth spruce populations occupied the studied peatlands between the 11th and 16th centuries, with stunted and erect spruce dominating the hilltop and the valley sites, respectively. Spruce continued to colonize the peatlands as long as the adjacent well-drained sites were occupied by forest trees able to attenuate the damaging effect of winter snow-drifting conditions. The surviving conifer stands exhibited similar growth responses following deforestation of the well-drained sites by wildfire in AD 1567-1568. These responses included dieback of supranival (above snow) stems and death of trees due to drowning in permafrost-induced ponds. The postfire degradation and disappearance of the conifer stands from the peatlands were the ultimate stage of a positive feedback process triggered by a modification of the snow regime at the landscape scale. Deforestation of the well-drained sites led to reduced snow accumulation and enhanced snow-drift exposure, thus inducing permafrost aggradation and drainage impediment in the nearby peatland sites. While the hilltop conifer stand responded immediately to forest exclusion in the nearby sites, ecosystem changes in the valley peatland were delayed until AD 1580-1590, at the beginning of the Little Ice Age. Our results emphasize the sensitivity and connectedness of adjoining ecosystems to fire and frost disturbances in a changing subarctic landscape mosaic.","UNIV LAVAL,DEPT BIOL,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; UNIV LAVAL,CTR ETUD NORD,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA",NA,40,17,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1997,78,"3",NA,NA,NA,693,"706",NA,NA,14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

What we do know about seed resources in deserts is based primarily on seeds extracted from soil samples, but this might present a distorted view of resource availability if animals mostly harvest newly produced seeds before they enter the soil seed bank. In order to assess how large the distortion might be, we simultaneously monitored the seed bank and ''seed rain'' over a 19-mo period in the eastern Mojave Desert of California. The seed bank averaged approximate to 106 000 seeds/m(2) and 38 g/m(2), much higher than values reported for other North American desert sites. This corresponds roughly to the seed production of a single year, since daily seed rain averaged 262 seeds/m(2) and 0.26 g/m(2). However, input from the seed rain did not accumulate in the soil. Instead, the seed bank decreased by a daily average of 114 seeds/m(2) and 0.007 g/m(2) during our study. This suggests that virtually all seeds germinate, die, or are harvested by granivores soon after being dispersed. Large seeds comprised a greater fraction of the seed rain than of the seed bank, suggesting that such seeds are differentially depleted, probably by granivores, before they enter the soil. Because seed drop was seasonal, temporal variation comprised a significant component of among-sample variance in the seed rain. Temporal variance in the seed bank was much smaller, presumably because granivores harvested most of the seed rain. Conversely, spatial variance was a significant component for the seed bank, but not the seed rain, perhaps as a result of spatial patterns of seed harvest or seed caching by granivores. By virtue of these variance patterns, as well as other attributes, seeds in the soil present different challenges to granivores than do newly produced seeds. Our understanding of desert granivore foraging and community ecology, and of granivore-seed interactions, depends critically on choosing the appropriate measure of seed availability to granivores.",NA,"Price, MV (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE, DEPT BIOL, RIVERSIDE, CA 92521 USA.",126,38,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1997,78,"3",NA,NA,NA,764,"773",NA,NA,10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Ecologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms that reduce the effects of stress and result in improved fitness. It has previously been suggested (1) that selection for stress resistance will bring about the evolution of lower standard metabolic rates and (2) that organisms with increased stress resistance will have a lower metabolic rate during stressful conditions, compared to stress-sensitive organisms. We have tested these hypotheses using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Desiccation and starvation-selected populations and their controls, as well as populations selected for postponed senescence and their short-generation controls were examined. The metabolic rate of each selected and control population was measured under three different environmental conditions: (1) desiccation (no food or water), (2) starvation (water present, no food), and (3) food condition (food and water present). The carbohydrate and lipid content of each population were also measured. All selected and control populations lowered their metabolic rates when measured under starving conditions compared to food conditions. The metabolic rates of flies under desiccating conditions did not differ from food conditions regardless of selection treatment. When comparing the mass-specific metabolic rates of stress-selected populations to their controls, stress-selected populations had a significantly lower mass-specific metabolic rate in all cases, regardless of the environmental conditions under which the measurements were made. However, once the mass of nonmetabolizing lipid and carbohydrate was accounted for and metabolic rate was expressed in carbohydrate-lipid free mass, selected populations did not differ significantly in metabolic rate from control populations, regardless of the environmental condition under which the measurements were made. We conclude that in the case of D. melanogaster, resistance to stress does not require the evolution of a lower metabolic rate.

Our main goal in this study was to provide estimates of true annual and lifetime reproductive success of male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) to determine the importance of extra-pair mating to reproductive success. Males that were more successful at extra-pair mating, both annually and over their lifetimes, were also more successful on their own territories, so extra-pair success was not achieved at the expense of within-pair success. Relative to within-pair success, extra-pair success accounted for only one-fifth as much variance in total success (annual and lifetime). For some individuals, however, extra-pair success was a substantial part of their total success. Standardized variance in true annual success was 16% higher overall than the variance in apparent success, although the effect was inconsistent from year to year. Standardized variance in lifetime success increased 39% due to extra-pair paternity. Thus, extra-pair mating modestly increased the opportunity for sexual selection. Males with the highest annual success on their own territories mated with more females on their territories, had fewer of those females mating with other males, and lost fewer nests to predation. Annual extra-pair success was highly correlated with the number of extra-pair mates. The number of years a male bred and the number of females with which he mated contributed significantly to the variance in lifetime success, both within pairs and extra-pair. Reproductive success in the first breeding season was significantly positively correlated with lifetime success. Positive correlations between true and apparent reproductive success and between true mating success and harem size suggest that conventional (i.e., nongenetic) estimates of success provide reasonable estimates of population patterns, despite being unreliable for estimating individual success. Many of the ecological factors that affected lifetime success (e.g., territory acquisition, longevity) of males and females appeared similar between our Canadian population and a population in Washington state, USA. However, variance in male success appears to be much higher in Washington, suggesting that exploiting this geographical variation might be a productive way to study sexual selection in this species.","QUEENS UNIV,DEPT BIOL,KINGSTON,ON K7L 3N6,CANADA","Weatherhead, PJ (corresponding author), CARLETON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,OTTAWA,ON K1S 5B6,CANADA.",51,18,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1997,78,"3",NA,NA,NA,884,"896",NA,NA,13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Assuming ''all else equal,'' a sexual lineage producing both males and females has a slower intrinsic growth rate than a clonal lineage producing only females. Hence, clones should rapidly outcompete their sexual counterparts, unless there are ecological or mutation-clearing advantages to sex, or unless the all-else-equal assumption is incorrect. Here we examined the crucial all-else-equal assumption using a lake population of freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in which both diploid sexual and triploid parthenogenetic individuals coexist. We contrasted the variation in life-history traits between sexual and clonal forms to the variation in life histories among habitats and sampling locations. We also conducted a laboratory experiment in which sexual snails competed with a single clone for 1 yr. We found that size at maturity varied among habitats within the lake, but this difference was not attributable to reproductive mode. There were also no differences among clonal and sexual individuals with respect either to brood size or to the frequency of developmental errors in brooded embryos. Finally, in the laboratory competition experiment, the growth rate of sexual individuals was significantly lower than the growth rate of snails from a single clone. Taken together, these results suggest that the all-else-equal assumption is correct, and that a cost of males exists in natural sexual populations of these snails.","INDIANA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA",NA,103,46,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1997,78,"2",NA,NA,NA,452,"460",NA,NA,9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The energy that female moose (Alces alces) store during the summer as body fat is used to meet energy needs in winter. The foraging strategy used by an animal affects its daily and annual energy balance. Consequently, foraging strategies and the distribution of food in the landscape can affect individual fitness and population growth through their effects on the energy balance of reproductive females. Models that unify landscape structure, foraging theory, and animal energy metabolism can be used to investigate the effects of foraging strategies on survival and reproduction. We developed an energy and activity simulation environment (EASE) model that predicts the seasonal changes in energy requirements of a female moose foraging in a spatially explicit landscape with a resolution of 1 m(2). We validated EASE for both moose and deer (Odocoileus spp.) with respect to body mass changes reported for feeding trials, activity times, and browse intake rates. Energy intake and body mass depended on forage abundance, its spatial distribution, and foraging strategy. In simulations with stochasticity imposed on model parameters, mean moose body mass decreased 4 kg in comparison to simulations that were deterministic. Simulated moose body mass was most sensitive to browse digestibility and least sensitive to maximum intake per day in 1-yr simulations. Moose using nonrandom foraging strategies had higher body mass and survival than moose using random foraging strategies. Differences between strategies increased as browse density decreased. Moose that selected foraging locations with higher food density or food items with higher digestibility deposited more fat and protein than less selective moose, leading to increased survival and reproduction.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA","Moen, R (corresponding author), NAT RESOURCES RES INST, CTR WATER & ENVIRONM, 5013 MILLER TRUNK HIGHWAY, DULUTH, MN 55811 USA.",106,55,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1997,78,"2",NA,NA,NA,505,"521",NA,NA,17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Ecologists often assemble data on species composition at different localities, habitat descriptions of these localities, and biological or behavioral traits of the species. These data tables are usually analysed two by two: species composition against habitat characteristics, or against behavioral data, using such methods as canonical analysis. We propose a solution to the problem of estimating the parameters describing the relationship between habitat characteristics and biology or behavior, and of testing the statistical significance of these parameters; this problem is referred to as the fourth-corner problem, from its matrix formulation. In other words, the fourth-corner method offers a way of analysing the relationships between the supplementary variables associated with the rows and columns of a binary (presence or absence) data table. The test case that motivated this study concerns a coral reef fish assemblage (280 species). Biological and behavioral characteristics of the species were used as supplementary variables for the rows, and characteristics of the environment for the columns. Parameters of the association between habitat characteristics (distance from beach, water depth, and substrate variables) and biological and behavioral traits of the species (feeding habits, ecological niche categories, size classes, egg types, activity rhythms) were estimated and tested for significance using permutations. Permutations can be performed in different ways, corresponding to different ecological hypotheses. Results were compared to predictions made independently by reef fish ecologists, in order to assess the method as well as the pertinence of the variables subjected to the analysis. The new method is shown to be applicable to a wide class of ecological problems.","UNIV PERPIGNAN, ECOLE PRAT HAUTES ETUD, LAB ICHTYOECOL TROP & MEDITERRANEENNE, CNRS, F-66860 PERPIGNAN, FRANCE; CTR OCEANOL MARSEILLE, MARINE ENDOUME STN,CNRS, F-13007 MARSEILLE, FRANCE; CTR RECH INSULAIRES, MOOREA, FRANCE; OBSERV ENVIRONM, MOOREA, FRANCE","Legendre, P (corresponding author), UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT SCI BIOL, CP 6128, SUCCURSALE CTR VILLE, MONTREAL, PQ H3C 3J7, CANADA.",301,102,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1997,78,"2",NA,NA,NA,547,"562",NA,NA,16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

However, there are many instances in which this assumption is unlikely to be met. We define two general models for the process of temporary emigration: completely random and Markovian. We then consider effects of these two types of temporary emigration on Jolly-Seber estimators and on estimators arising from the full-likelihood approach to robust design data. Capture-recapture data arising from Pollock's robust design provide the basis for obtaining unbiased estimates of demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emigration, and for estimating the probability of temporary emigration. We present a likelihood-based approach to dealing with temporary emigration that permits estimation under different models of temporary emigration and yields tests for completely random and Markovian emigration. In addition, we use the relationship between capture probability estimates based on closed and open models under completely random temporary emigration to derive three ad hoc estimators for the probability of temporary emigration. Two of these should be especially useful in situations where capture probabilities are heterogeneous among individual animals. Ad hoc and full-likelihood estimators are illustrated for small-mammal capture-recapture data sets. We believe that these models and estimators will be useful for testing hypotheses about the process of temporary emigration, for estimating demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emigration, and for estimating probabilities of temporary emigration. These latter estimates are frequently of ecological interest as indicators of animal movement and, in some sampling situations, as direct estimates of breeding probabilities and proportions.","US FISH & WILDLIFE SERV, OFF MIGRATORY BIRD MANAGEMENT, LAUREL, MD 20708 USA","Kendall, WL (corresponding author), NATL BIOL SERV, PATUXENT WILDLIFE RES CTR, 11510 AMER HOLLY DR, LAUREL, MD 20708 USA.",577,96,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","MAR",1997,78,"2",NA,NA,NA,563,"578",NA,NA,16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Four striking points emerged. First, the properties of this single web vary markedly with the intensity of sampling: incompleteness of data can strongly bias estimates of food-web properties. Second, the original values are reached only after a high level of sampling, much higher than is typical for many studies. Third, the properties of most webs in the ECOWeB database lie at the poorly sampled end of the ranges.

The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance.

Although there is a good understanding of the probabilities of seedling establishment of Bromus pictus in relation to location within these patches, these probabilities account for only a portion of the spatial dynamics of the community. The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We first evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (less than or equal to 10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analysed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bare-ground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals. Vegetation patches play an important role in modifying ecological processes in arid and semiarid communities. Our results highlight the importance of seed distribution in the formation and maintenance of these patches.","UNIV BUENOS AIRES,FAC AGRON,IFEVA,RA-1417 BUENOS AIRES,DF,ARGENTINA","Aguiar, MR (corresponding author), UNIV BUENOS AIRES,DEPT ECOL,AV SAN MARTIN 4453,RA-1417 BUENOS AIRES,DF,ARGENTINA.",146,16,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1997,78,"1",NA,NA,NA,93,"100",NA,NA,8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Although this species was formerly thought to be strictly dioecious, in a survey of 24 Ochradenus populations along a latitudinal rainfall gradient, we found sex expression to be extremely variable. While females reproduced only by seeds, males ranged across a continuum from ''pure males'' that produced only pollen to ''inconstant males,'' which produced seeds in addition to pollen. For sexual dimorphism to evolve from cosexuality, it is believed that the sex morphs must be compensated for their loss of one sex function (e.g., pollen production) by an increase in the remaining sex function (i.e., seed production). In our study we found that females produced 9-20 times as many seeds as males, and we showed in a controlled laboratory experiment that their offspring had higher germination and seedling growth rates. Pure males invested more biomass in stamens than did inconstant males. Previously published models concerned with the evolution of sexual dimorphisms have predicted that: (1) the frequency of inconstant males should be inversely related to the frequency of females, and (2) if the degree of male inconstancy is influenced by environmental factors, then seed production in males should decline along with habitat quality. We found support for both of these predictions. Although the sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1 in 19 of the 24 populations surveyed, the frequency of male inconstancy did vary geographically. The fraction of males that produced fruit in a population declined on a north-south gradient that reflected a three-fold decline in rainfall. Among populations, the frequency of females was negatively correlated with the frequency of inconstant males. We postulate that the advantages of conditional fruit production in males (i.e., ability to produce seeds during periods of unpredictable pollinator service) will result in gynodioecy and male inconstancy remaining a stable feature of populations of O. baccatus.","HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,DEPT EVOLUT SYSTEMAT & ECOL,JERUSALEM,ISRAEL","Wolfe, LM (corresponding author), GEORGIA SO UNIV,DEPT BIOL,STATESBORO,GA 30460, USA.",95,13,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1997,78,"1",NA,NA,NA,101,"110",NA,NA,10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The response of the larvae to two flow parameters-flow direction and shear (i.e., velocity)-was examined by using two different substratum morphologies (flat plate and cylinder), which induce distinct flow patterns. Settling cyphonautes larvae possess a mechanism of locomotion, in addition to swimming, which may facilitate exploration in flow conditions that otherwise would sweep the larvae away. The results show that cyphonautes larvae are able to explore substrata in all directions in flow velocities that are much faster than their locomotion speeds, and that their preferential motion is upstream. This behavior has been largely ignored to date despite its potential ecological importance. For instance, upstream exploration may enable larvae to locate specific, obligatory settlement sites by tracking waterborne chemicals to their sources.","STANFORD UNIV,HOPKINS MARINE STN,PACIFIC GROVE,CA 93950",NA,41,13,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1997,78,"1",NA,NA,NA,160,"166",NA,NA,7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass.

This research evaluated how plant phytochemical responses to enriched atmospheric CO2 are affected by the availability of soil nitrate (NO3-) and how these chemical changes, in turn, alter the performance of a tree-feeding folivore. Seedlings of three deciduous tree species-quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-were grown in ambient (355 mu L/L) or elevated (650 mu L/L) CO2 in combination with low (1.25 mmol/L) or high (7.5 mmol/L) soil NO3- availability. After 60 d, foliage was analysed for changes in nutrients and allelochemicals likely to be influenced by the availability of CO2 and NO3-. Penultimate gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar) were reared on foliage (aspen and maple) to determine how performance would be affected by host chemical changes. Using the framework of carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) theory, we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of CO2 and NO3- availability on plant chemistry and insect performance: (1) nitrogen-based compounds will decrease, and carbon-based compounds will increase in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-; (2) aspen will exhibit the greatest change in C:N ratios, and maple the least; and (3) phytochemical changes will influence gypsy moth performance, with larvae fed aspen being affected more than those fed maple. Concentrations of nitrogen and soluble protein decreased, whereas concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and ellagitannins increased, in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-. Responses of simple carbohydrates and phenolic glycosides were variable, however, suggesting that foliar accumulations of ''dynamic metabolites'' do not follow the predictions of CNB theory as well as do those of stable end products. With respect to Hypothesis 2, we found that absolute (net) changes in foliar C:N ratios were greatest for aspen and least for oak, whereas relative (proportional) changes were greatest for maple and least for aspen. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was only partially supported by the data. Considering Hypothesis 3, we found that elevated CO2 treatments had little effect on gypsy moth development time, growth rate, or larval mass. Larvae reared on aspen foliage grown under elevated CO2 exhibited increased consumption but decreased conversion efficiencies. Gypsy moth responses to NO3- were strongly host specific: the highest consumption and food digestibility occurred in larvae on high-NO3- aspen, whereas the fastest growth rates occurred in larvae on high-NO3- maple. In short, our results again only partially supported the predicted pattern, They indicate, however, that the magnitude of insect response elicited by resource-mediated shifts in host chemistry will depend on how levels of compounds with specific importance to insect fitness (e.g., phenolic glycosides in aspen) are affected. Overall, we observed relatively few true interactions (i.e,, nonadditive) between carbon and nitrogen availability vis a vis foliar chemistry and insect performance. Tree species, however, frequently interacted with CO2 and/or NO3- availability to affect both sets of parameters. These results suggest that the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial plant communities will not be homogeneous, but will depend on species composition and soil nutrient availability.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ENTOMOL, RUSSELL LABS 237, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT FORESTRY, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT STAT, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",NA,155,39,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1997,78,"1",NA,NA,NA,215,"230",NA,NA,16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Water quality was characterized by standard procedures. Ecological profile methods were used to investigate (for each species and each water quality variable) whether stress index or frequency of occurrence varied significantly along environmental gradients. Most stress profiles showed significant departures from uniformity, whereas many frequency profiles did not, indicating that the stress index approach is more sensitive to differences in water quality than are approaches based simply on presence/absence data. To further investigate relationships between water quality variables and D665/D665a ratio, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used. The first axis extracted by CCA was clearly closely related to degree of organic pollution. The second axis was most strongly correlated with pH.

Although A. longimana preferentially consumes D. menstrualis, its feeding rates can be reduced significantly by high concentrations of diterpenoid dictyols produced by the alga. In 1991, D. menstrualis from sites with high numbers of A. longimana had higher levels of grazing scars, higher concentrations of dictyols, and were less palatable to A. longimana than plants from sites with few amphipods. Among-site differences in palatability to amphipods did not correlate with plant differences in protein, nitrogen, or carbon content. Within a site, plants that had apparent amphipod grazing scars were significantly less palatable to A. longimana than neighboring undamaged plants. Controlled field experiments manipulating A. longimana densities supported the hypothesis that feeding by this amphipod induced elevated chemical defenses in the alga. Compared to undamaged control plants, amphipod-damaged plants had 19-34% more of three diterpenoid secondary metabolites and were 50% less palatable to amphipods. Soluble protein and thallus toughness were unaffected by amphipod grazing and thus could not have caused the differences in palatability. High-pressure liquid chromatography evaluation of adventitious branches growing from blade margins at sites of amphipod grazing scars showed that these branches had significantly elevated levels of two diterpenoids relative to normal blade apices or middles. Thus, the amphipod-induced resistance to further attack occurs through an increase in chemical defenses, and these defenses are, to some extent, localized within the plant thallus. Among-site differences in amphipod densities, grazing scars, seaweed defensive chemistry, and plant palatability that we documented in 1991 varied considerably during 1992 and 1993, suggesting that these interrelationships may be complex. In 1992, A. longimana densities did not differ between sites, and there were no between-site differences in palatability or concentrations of deterrent secondary metabolites. In 1993, however, A. longimana densities did differ between sites, but between-site differences were less dramatic than in 1991. Some secondary metabolites were slightly, but significantly, increased at the site with higher densities of A. longimana, but this had no effect on A. longimana feeding. It has been long recognized that marine herbivores are active participants in seaweed-herbivore interactions and can greatly influence the structure of benthic algal communities. Our findings suggest that seaweeds are not passive participants in these interactions, but can actively alter their susceptibility to herbivores in ecological time. Induced responses to herbivory help explain both spatial (i.e., within-thallus, within-site, and among-site) and temporal variation in the chemical defenses of D. menstrualis.","UNIV N CAROLINA,INST MARINE SCI,MOREHEAD CITY,NC 28557",NA,176,68,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1996,77,"8",NA,NA,NA,2287,"2301",NA,"10.2307/2265731",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Nevertheless, the explanations are thought to be applicable to other groups. In order to study the generality of hypotheses about the effect of morphology on foraging ecology, I investigated the foraging decisions of Chilean sigmodontine rodents (Muridae) in the laboratory, experimentally manipulating nocturnal illumination (a surrogate of predation risk) and food distribution. Three coexisting rodent species from the Chilean matorral were compared: two quadrupeds, one with large body size (Phyllotis darwini) and another with small body size (Abrothrix olivaceus), and one small species with bipedal escape behavior (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). The species did not differ in patch utilization and food consumption in response to different food distributions. However, there was an overall significant effect of illumination on food consumption. When illumination was higher, A. olivaceus and P. darwini increased food transportation to the refuge and decreased patch consumption and total food consumption. They also increased significantly the number of trips between food patch and refuge. P. darwini showed the most cautious foraging behavior. O. longicaudatus was insensitive to different conditions of illumination. It is argued that a large body size and quadrupedal locomotion seem to confer higher sensitivity to nocturnal illumination. Bipedality may confer less vulnerability to predation, and quadrupedal species show facultative central-place foraging, diminishing a possible greater vulnerability to potential risk, Former explanations for different foraging behaviors under the risk of predation may not be as general as previously assumed.

The third process can interact with either of the first two to produce distinct effects. Each process can lead to a different distribution of genotypes and phenotypes between active and dormant subpopulations. We compared the phenotypic distributions of an important fitness character for individuals collected from active and diapausing subpopulations of a freshwater copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, with a long-lived egg bank. The character, seasonal timing of the switch from production of immediately hatching eggs to diapausing eggs, determines the relative representation of copepods with different switch dates in future generations and is subject to fluctuating selection due to year-to-year changes in the timing and intensity of the seasonal onset of fish predation. The mean timing of diapause is significantly later in the season for copepods reared eggs than it is for copepods reared from individuals collected from the water column. Phenotypic variance for diapause timing does not differ between the two subpopulations. Within the sediment subpopulation, the distribution gf diapause timing depends upon two features of the diapausing eggs: (1) individuals originating from eggs near the sediment surface exhibit a slightly earlier switch date with greater phenotypic variance than individuals from deep in the sediments, and (2) individuals from eggs that hatched shortly after they were collected from sediments have a later seasonal switch to diapause than those that hatched later in time. We hypothesize that our results are explained bg adaptive covariance between traits that influences how long an egg spends in the sediments before hatching and traits that influence the seasonal timing of diapause. The covariance may result from either phenotypic plasticity or from genetic covariance between diapause timing and hatching probability.","N CAROLINA STATE UNIV,DEPT STAT,BIOMATH PROGRAM,RALEIGH,NC 27695","Hairston, NG (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",69,32,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1996,77,"8",NA,NA,NA,2382,"2392",NA,"10.2307/2265740",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The purpose of this paper is to report on field and laboratory experiments that link this pattern of abundance to biotic interactions among larvae. In the first field experiment, growth and survival were compared in single and mixed species treatments in littoral enclosures. Larvae, which eat mainly vascular plant detritus, grew at similar rates among treatments in both temporary and permanent habitats suggesting that exploitative competition is not important under natural food levels and caddisfly densities. However, the survival of Limnephilus larvae was reduced in the presence of Asynarchus larvae. Subsequent behavioral studies in laboratory arenas revealed that Asynarchus larvae are extremely aggressive predators on Limnephilus larvae. In a second field experiment we manipulated the relative sizes of larvae and found that Limnephilus larvae were preyed on only when Asynarchus larvae had the same size advantage observed in natural populations. Our data suggest that the dominance of Asynarchus larvae in temporary habitats is due to asymmetric intraguild predation (IGP) facilitated by a phenological head start in development. These data do not explain the dominance of Limnephilus larvae in permanent basins, which we show elsewhere to be an indirect effect of salamander predation. Behavioral observations also revealed that Asynarchus larvae are cannibalistic. In contrast to the IGP on Limnephilus larvae, Asynarchus cannibalism occurs among same-sized larvae and often involves the mobbing of one victim by several conspecifics. In a third field experiment, we found that Asynarchus cannibalism was not density-dependent and occurred even at low larval densities. We hypothesize that Asynarchus IGP and cannibalism provide a dietary supplement to detritus that may be necessary for the timely completion of development in these nutrient-poor, high-elevation wetlands.","ALLEGHENY COLL,DEPT ENVIRONM SCI,MEADVILLE,PA 16335; ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,CRESTED BUTTE,CO 81224; UNIV COLORADO,DEPT EPO BIOL,BOULDER,CO 80301","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), ALLEGHENY COLL,DEPT BIOL,MEADVILLE,PA 16335, USA.",81,31,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1996,77,"8",NA,NA,NA,2421,"2430",NA,"10.2307/2265743",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We designed a field experiment to test how differences in the aerial extent of disturbance affected macrofaunal recolonization on a sandflat. Three different plot sizes (0.203 m(2), 0.81 m(2), and 3.24 m(2)) were defaunated, and samples were collected to assess recovery over a 9-mo period. As the sandflat used for the experiment was prone to disturbance by wind-driven waves, we also measured changes in sediment bed height (an indicator of sediment stability) over the course of the experiment. Most common species revealed significant relationships between density and disturbance plot size. Scale-dependent recovery was also demonstrated by differences in species assemblage structure over the course of the experiment. Relative rates of colonization varied by approximate to 50% between large and small experimental plots. However, these differences were not related to specific species, particular functional groups, or potential modes or colonization. The results revealed an unusually slow rate of faunal recovery following defaunation. Both increasing numbers of colonists and density changes in ambient sediments made an important contribution to recovery. The relationship found between changes in sediment bed height and wind velocity indicated that wind-driven wave disturbance was an important factor influencing sediment instability. Sediment instability was higher in all experimental plots than in the ambient sediments, due to the initial removal of a dense spionid polychaete tube mat characteristically found at the study site. Sediment instability also increased with increasing plot size. Thus in this dynamic sandflat habitat, faunal emigration from recovering disturbed patches of sediment may significantly slow rates of recolonization. These results demonstrate that incorporating patch size, emigration, recovery time, and interactions between hydrodynamic conditions and habitat ability (particularly where colonists influence sediment stability) are crucial to generating a general understanding of recovery processes in soft-sediment habitats. While our results demonstrate the need for caution in scaling-up from small-scale studies, they do indicate that larger scale disturbances that destroy organisms with a role in maintaining habitat stability are likely to result in very slow recovery dynamics, particularly in wave-disturbed sofi-sediment habitats.","UNIV CONNECTICUT,DEPT MARINE SCI,GROTON,CT 06340","Thrush, SF (corresponding author), NATL INST WATER & ATMOSPHER RES,POB 11-115,HAMILTON,NEW ZEALAND.",184,35,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1996,77,"8",NA,NA,NA,2472,"2487",NA,"10.2307/2265747",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This structure allows for improved estimation of individual parameters by considering them in the context of a group of related parameters. Individual estimates are differentially adjusted toward an overall mean, with the magnitude of their adjustment based on their precision. Consequently, Bayesian estimation allows for a more reliable ranking of parameters and, in particular, a more credible identification of extreme values from a collection of estimates. In Bayesian models, individual parameters are regarded as values sampled from a specified probability distribution, called a prior. The requirement that the prior be known is often regarded as an unattractive feature of Bayesian analysis and may be the reason Bayesian analyses are not frequently applied in ecological studies. Empirical Bayes methods provide an alternative approach that incorporates the structural advantages of Bayesian models while requiring a less stringent specification of prior knowledge. Empirical Bayes methods require only that the prior be in a certain family of distributions, indexed by hyperparameters that can be estimated from the available data. This structure is of interest per se, in addition to its value in allowing for improved estimation of individual parameters: for example, hypotheses regarding the existence of distinct subgroups in a collection of parameters can be considered under the empirical Bayes framework by allowing the hyperparameters to vary among subgroups. We describe the empirical Bayes approach in application to estimation of proportions, rising data obtained in a community-wide study of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism rates for illustration. Empirical Bayes estimates identify those species for which there is the greatest evidence of extreme parasitism rates. Subgroup analysis of our data on cowbird parasitism rates indicates that parasitism rater For neotropical migrants as a group are no greater than those of resident/short-distance migrant species in this forest community.

We undertook a study of the community ecology of irrigated tropical rice fields on Java, Indonesia, as a supporting study for the Indonesian National Integrated Pest Management Programme, whose purpose is to train farmers to be better agronomists and to employ the principles of integrated pest management (IPM). Two of our study objectives, reported on here, were (1) to explore whether there exist general and consistent patterns of arthropod community dynamics related to natural or intrinsic levels of biological control, and (2) to understand how the existing levels of biological control are affected by insecticide use, as well as by large-scale habitat factors relating to differing patterns for vegetational landscapes, planting times, and the length of dry fallow periods. We performed a series of observational studies and two experimental studies. Abundant and well-distributed populations of generalist predators can be found in most early-season tropical rice fields. We took samples from plants and water surface using a vacuum-suction device, and from the subsurface using a dip net. Our results show that high populations of generalist predators are likely to be supported, in the early season, by feeding on abundant populations of detritus-feeding and plankton-feeding insects, whose populations consistently peak and decline in the first third of the season. We hypothesize that since this abundance of alternative prey gives the predator populations a ''head start'' on later-developing pest populations, this process should strongly suppress pest populations and generally lend stability to rice ecosystems by decoupling predator populations from a strict dependence on herbivore populations. We experimentally tested our hypothesis of trophic linkages among organic matter, detritivores and plankton feeders, and generalist predators and showed that by increasing organic matter in test plots we could boost populations of detritivores and plankton-feeders, and in turn significantly boost the abundance of generalist predators. These results hold for populations found on the plant, on the water surface, and below the water surface. We also demonstrated the link between early-season natural enemy populations and later-season pest populations by experimentally reducing early-season predator populations with insecticide applications, causing pest populations to resurge later in the season. Overall, these results demonstrate the existence of a mechanism in tropical irrigated rice systems that supports high levels of natural biological control. This mechanism depends on season-long successional processes and interactions among a wide array of species, many of which have hitherto been ignored as important elements in a rice ecosystem. Our results support a management strategy that promotes the conservation of existing natural biological control through a major reduction in insecticide use, and the corresponding increase in habitat heterogeneity.","INDONESIAN NATL INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRA,JAKARTA 12510,INDONESIA; LAB PENGENDALIAN HAMA PENYAKIT TANAMAN PANGAN,BANTUL,DIY,INDONESIA",NA,482,131,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1996,77,"7",NA,NA,NA,1975,"1988",NA,"10.2307/2265694",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The purpose of this article is to show how recent theoretical advances may reverse this situation. We first discuss four issues that have arisen in the development of theory for biological control. (1) Recent work has clarified and resolved earlier disagreements concerning the effect of aggregation of the parasitoid to local host density on the stability of parasitoid-host models; this work emphasizes that such aggregation increases the ability of the parasitoid to reduce pest density, (2) There has been disagreement over the conditions under which stability, in the mathematical sense and on a local spatial scale, is an appropriate goal for classical biological control of insect pests, and whether a metapopulation may sometimes provide a more appropriate framework. We also comment on (3) relative size of refuges, which has been proposed as a unifying concept, and (4) density dependence and ratio dependence. We then discuss recent models using a stage-structured approach, particularly those that compare potential biological control agents or agents that have been differentially successful in practice. We argue that this approach has already produced valuable insights into the factors operating in several field situations. It demonstrates the importance of identifying which pest stages are most injurious to the crop, since the natural enemy that wins in competition may not be the most effective at suppressing the crucial pest stage(s): in general, the winning parasitoid reduces the density of the host stage attacked by its competitor below the level at which the latter can maintain a positive growth rate when at low density. A useful criterion is that pest equilibrium density is suppressed most by the parasitoid species that needs the fewest host individuals to allow a female parasitoid to replace herself in the next generation. Caveats are that this may apply only under equilibrium conditions and that the pest stage most suppressed is the one we wish to control. We discuss the connection between successful biological control and evolutionary considerations.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI TECHNOL & MED, DEPT BIOL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND","Murdoch, WW (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",170,64,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1996,77,"7",NA,NA,NA,2001,"2013",NA,"10.2307/2265696",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Our ability to quantitatively predict these impacts is, in part, limited by the absence of suitable plant-spread models and by inadequate parameter estimates for such models. This paper explores the effects of model, plant, and environmental attributes on predicted rates and patterns of spread of alien pine trees (Pinus spp.) in South African fynbos (a mediterranean-type shrubland). A factorial experimental design was used to: (1) compare the predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion model and a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model; (2) investigate the sensitivity of predicted rates and patterns of spread to parameter values; and (3) quantify the effects of the simulation model's spatial grain on its predictions. The results show that the spatial simulation model places greater emphasis on interactions among ecological processes than does the reaction-diffusion model. This ensures that the predictions of the two models differ substantially for some factor combinations. The most important factor in the model is dispersal ability. Fire frequency, fecundity, and age of reproductive maturity are less important, while adult mortality has little effect on the model's predictions. The simulation model's predictions are sensitive to the model's spatial grain. This suggests that simulation models that use matrices as a spatial framework should ensure that the spatial grain of the model is compatible with the spatial processes being modeled. We conclude that parameter estimation and model development must be integrated procedures. This will ensure that the model's structure is compatible with the biological processes being modeled.

They have been applied extensively to study the impacts of climatic change on ecosystems although they originally were not built for this purpose. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a new forest gap model, FORCLIM, that includes only a minimum number of ecological assumptions but robust parameterizations of the effects of climate on plant population dynamics; (2) to test the realism of FORCLIM as compared to its predecessor model, FORECE; and (3) to examine the behavior of FORECE and FORCLIM systematically along climate gradients in Europe. FORCLIM is composed of three modular submodels: FORCLIM-P for plant population dynamics, FORCLIM-S for soil carbon/nitrogen turnover, and FORCLIM-E for providing reliable parameterizations of the abiotic environment. For the core model, FORCLIM-P, it was found that only four factors are sufficient to model tree growth, another four factors are required to model tree establishment, and only two factors are required to model tree mortality. The behavior of FORCLIM was tested at a large number of sites in the European Alps. The model yields tree species compositions that conform to field data and are very similar to those of the predecessor model. Based on this evaluation alone, it would not be possible to favor one of the models over the other. The behavior of both models then was examined systematically in a parameter space spanned by the annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation sum. From this exercise it became evident;hat both the pattern of aboveground biomass and the realized niches of the dominating tree species are simulated realistically by FORCLIM. Extremely steep gradients are characteristic of FORECE, and many ecotones are simulated to occur in the wrong places in FORECE. Thus, some of the current forest gap models can be simplified without reducing the realism of their behavior, and models other than FORECE should be scrutinized in this respect as well. The present study also suggests that the evaluation of model behavior at scattered sites is insufficient to show their validity for simulating forest dynamics along climate gradients. Further rigorous model comparisons and validation studies are required to increase the reliability of this promising class of models.","SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,CH-8952 SCHLIEREN,SWITZERLAND",NA,220,55,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1996,77,"7",NA,NA,NA,2055,"2074",NA,"10.2307/2265700",20,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Here, I critically examine the key assumption of the fractal approach: that the estimated fractal dimension is constant over some biologically relevant range of spatial scales. Use of a correlated random walk as a null hypothesis for movement suggests thar the fractal dimension should grade smoothly from near 1 at very small spatial scares to near 2 at very Large spatial scales. Several empirical data sets exhibit a qualitative pattern in agreement with this prediction. I conclude that ecologists should avoid calculating and using the fractal dimension of movement paths, unless self-similarity (a constant fractal dimension) for some range of spatial scales is demonstrated.

In these experiments, glucose was the sole source of carbon provided, and its concentration was limiting to population density. Thus, the stable polymorphism did not conform to a simple model of competitive exclusion. In similar experiments also with glucose as the sole resource, we considered two hypotheses that might explain the observed coexistence: (1) a strictly demographic trade-off, such that one genotype is competitively superior when glucose is abundant whereas the other genotype is the better competitor for sparse glucose; and (2) a cross-feeding interaction, whereby the superior competitor for glucose excretes a metabolite that acts as a second resource for which the other genotype is the better competitor. Although there was a demographic tradeoff, the advantage to the superior competitor at high glucose concentrations was too large off, the advantage to the superior competitor at high glucose concentrations was too large (given the initial concentration of glucose used in these experiments) to allow the second genotype to invade when rare at the observed rate. Therefore, the second genotype must have had some other advantage that allowed it to readily invade a population of the superior competitor for glucose. Indeed, the second genotype could increase in abundance after glucose was depleted, but only in the presence of the superior competitor for glucose thus implicating a cross-feeding interaction. These results confirmed earlier studies showing that populations of E. coli can maintain ecologically relevant genetic diversity even in a simple environment.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, CTR MICROBIAL ECOL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA; UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, CTR ECOL, MEXICO CITY 04510, DF, MEXICO",NA,113,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1996,77,"7",NA,NA,NA,2119,"2129",NA,"10.2307/2265706",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Conventional correlation analysis, however, (1) fundamentally conflicts with the basic ecological concept of limiting factors, and (2) ignores spatial structure in data, which can produce spuriously high correlations. Especially for field data, bivariate scattergrams often show ''factor-ceiling'' distributions wherein data points are widely scattered beneath an upper limit, due to the action of other factors. Although most ecological information in such a graph resides in the upper limit, standard correlation/regression does not characterize such limits. If other factors have been measured, path analysis may be useful, but otherwise, direct description of ecological ceilings is desirable. Objective methods for doing so are barely known to ecologists; we review recent proposals for statistical testing and data display. For correcting correlations for spatial patchiness of the variables, another new technique has been proposed by Clifford, Richardson, and Hemon: by reducing the effective sample size to account for the autocorrelation it allows significance tests. We discuss these issues with reference to counts of glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) seedlings, vegetative plants, and flowering plants in a square grid of 256 contiguous 2 x 2 m quadrats in subalpine meadow in western Colorado. We also measured soil moisture, pocket gopher activity, and soil rockiness. All six variables showed significant patchiness (spatial autocorrelation) at similar scales. The abundance of flowering plants was positively correlated with rockiness and negatively correlated with moisture and gopher activity. Although limited seed dispersal suggests that seedlings should be spatially associated with flowering plants, no such correlation existed: indeed, examination of the bivariate scatterplot suggests a negative association, in the particular and restricted sense that seedlings are abundant only in quadrats where flowering is low. We hypothesize that seed germination is higher in less rocky areas of deeper, moister soil than in the rocky areas where most seeds land, but that seedlings seldom reach maturity unless they are in a rocky refuge from predation. Results from path analysis are consistent with this hypothesis. Such an ecological situation should weaken natural selection on characters enhancing seed dispersal.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA; UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT SCI BIOL, MONTREAL, PQ H3C 3J7, CANADA","Thomson, JD (corresponding author), SUNY STONY BROOK, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA.",312,69,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","SEP",1996,77,"6",NA,NA,NA,1698,"1715",NA,"10.2307/2265776",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The effects on those traits of parental genotype, parental environment, and their interaction were tested by analysis of variance. The results showed that parental genotypes altered offspring traits in response to particular resource limits, such that offspring quality was maintained or enhanced despite parental resource deprivation. By maximizing the probability of offspring success, resource-deprived parental plants may partly offset the reduction in their fitness due to lower offspring number. Although overall patterns of plasticity were common to all parents, even this small sample revealed differences among parental genotypes in their response to environment.

We compared observed behaviors and T(b)s to the predictions of two hypotheses. The ''no thermoregulation'' null hypothesis predicted that lizard activity and microsite use would be unaffected by thermal constraints. The ''only thermoregulation'' hypothesis predicted that lizards would be active only at those times and in those places where T(e)s fell within the selected temperature range. To evaluate the contributions of various behavioral adjustments (activity times, use of microhabitats and sun-shade patches, basking, and shuttling) to temperature regulation, we combined results from direct behavioral observations with information on the T(e)s available at different times of day and in different microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches). Lizard activity patterns did not match the predictions of either hypothesis, but the observed pattern of activity produced T(e)s that were, on average, 1.0 degrees C closer to the selected temperature range than were T(b)s predicted by the ''no thermoregulation'' hypothesis.

Nevertheless, the lizards' use of specific microsites produced T(b)s that were, on average, 1.9 degrees C closer to the selected temperature range than were randomly available T(e)s. The relative contributions of different behavioral mechanisms varied with time of day. In the early morning, low movement rates, selection of sunny microsites, and most notably, adoption of a basking posture contributed to temperature regulation, In the late morning and early afternoon, no thermoregulatory behaviors were necessary, as indicated by randomly positioned models that achieved mean T(e)s within the selected temperature range. At midday, frequent movements between sunny and shaded microsites probably reduced heat loads on lizards, preventing T(b)s from exceeding the selected temperature range. In the late afternoon, nonrandom use of microsites and basking behavior appeared to contribute equally to the elevation of T(b)s above randomly sampled T(e)s.","COLUMBIA UNIV,BARNARD COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,NEW YORK,NY 10027; UNIV INSTELLING ANTWERP,DEPT BIOL,B-2610 WILRIJK,BELGIUM; INST MEDITERRANEO ESTUDIOS AVANZADOS,CSIC,E-07071 PALMA DE MALLORCA,SPAIN","Bauwens, D (corresponding author), INST NAT CONSERVAT,KLIN ST 25,B-1070 BRUSSELS,BELGIUM.",167,61,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1996,77,"6",NA,NA,NA,1818,"1830",NA,"10.2307/2265786",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Field metabolic rates (FMR) and feeding rates (estimated from rates of water influx and rates of change in dry mass) were highly variable. This variability was manifested at several levels, including seasonal changes within populations, year-to-year differences within populations, and differences between populations. Underlying observed patterns and contrasts was considerable variation among individuals. Much of the variation in energetic variables was associated with a single climatic variable, rainfall. Seasonal, annual, and interpopulation differences in FMR and foraging rates corresponded to differences in availability of free-standing water from rainstorms. At least some of the differences among individuals were apparently due to differences in proclivity or ability to drink. Tortoises had very low FMRs relative to other reptiles, which allowed them to tolerate long periods of chronic energy shortage during a drought. Calculations suggested that tortoises experienced a net loss of energy on their spring diet of succulent annual plants. If so, tortoises require drier forage to accrue an energy profit, which emphasizes their reliance on drinking rainwater (which can be stored in the bladder and resorbed later to hydrate dry forage). Further, it suggests that growth (as protein deposition) and net acquisition of energy may be temporally decoupled in desert tortoises, which has potential consequences for geographic variation in life history traits. Energy acquisition and expenditure in desert tortoises are thus strongly constrained by the contingencies of rainfall, both indirectly through effects on availability and quality of food, and directly through reliance on free-standing water for drinking, which is apparently necessary for achieving a net annual energy profit.",NA,"Peterson, CC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90095, USA.",83,36,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1996,77,"6",NA,NA,NA,1831,"1844",NA,"10.2307/2265787",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Spectacular migrations of these fishes occur at the end of the rainy season into the Andean foothills. Prochilodus ingest large quantities of sediments and may thereby modify habitats in neotropical streams. The major objectives of this study were (1) to explore experimentally the importance of Prochilodus in structuring a tropical stream in the Venezuelan Andean piedmont, and (2) to determine whether there was sufficient ecological redundancy in a diverse and abundant assemblage of epibenthic fishes to compensate for the removal of Prochilodus. Community structure was compared among three experimental treatments: (1) Prochilodus exclusion, (2) Prochilodus enclosure, and (3) the natural fish assemblage. Selective exclusion of Prochilodus resulted in striking changes in community structure as measured by patterns of sediment accrual and the composition of algal and invertebrate assemblages. Highly significant increases in total dry mass and in ash-free dry mass of sediments accruing on stream-bottom substrates were observed almost immediately following the exclusion of Prochilodus. Moreover the composition of algal and invertebrate assemblages was significantly modified by Prochilodus. Taxa such as diatoms were reduced in number when Prochilodus was present; in contrast, Prochilodus appeared to facilitate nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Total invertebrate densities were greatest in the Prochilodus removal treatment; however, a variety of responses to the experimental treatments was observed among different taxa analyzed individually, including density reductions, increases, and no measurable effects. This study suggests that the detritivore Prochilodus is a functionally dominant species in Andean foothill streams via sediment-processing activities.

Mayfly drift dispersal behavior, use of high vs. low food (periphyton or detritus) patches, microhabitat use, positioning, and activity periodicity were observed in the presence and absence of predators in circular flow-through chambers using natural stream water. Also, distances from predators at which prey initiated escape responses were compared among prey and predator species. Costs of predator avoidance behavior were assessed by measuring short-term (24-h) feeding rates of mayflies in the presence or absence of predatory stoneflies whose mouthparts were immobilized (glued) to prevent feeding. The intensity and associated costs of predator avoidance behavior of mayfly species were consistent with their relative rates of predation by stoneflies. Megarcys consumes overwintering generation Baetis bicaudatus > Epeorus longimanus > Cinygmula = Ephemerella; Kogotus consumes summer generation Baetis > Epeorus deceptivus = Cinygmula; Megarcys eats more mayflies than Kogotus. While Megarcys induced drift by Baetis, Epeorus, and Cinygmula, this disruptive predator avoidance behavior only reduced food intake by Baetis and Epeorus. The morphologically defended mayfly species, Ephemerella, neither showed escape behavior from Megarcys, nor any cost of its antipredatory posturing behavior. Only Baetis responded by drifting from Kogotus. No mayfly species shifted microhabitats or spent less time on high-food patches in the presence of foraging stoneflies. However, predators enhanced the nocturnal periodicity of Baetis drift, which was negligible in the absence of stoneflies as long as food was abundant. Lack of food also caused some microhabitat and periodicity shifts and increased the magnitude of both day and night drift of Baetis. Thus, Baetis took more risks of predation by visual, drift-feeding fish not only in the presence of predatory stoneflies, but also when food was low or they were hungry. All other mayflies were generally nocturnal in their use of rock surfaces, as long as food was abundant. Finally, the distances at which different mayfly species initiated acute escape responses were also consistent with relative rates of predation. This study demonstrates alternative predator avoidance syndromes by mayfly species ranging from an initial investment in constitutive morphological defenses (e.g., Ephemerella) to induced, energetically costly predator avoidance behaviors (e.g., Baetis). Although the costs of Ephemerella's constitutive defense are unknown, experiments show that prey dispersal is the mechanism underlying fecundity costs of induced responses by Baetis to predators, rather than microhabitat shifts to less favorable resources or temporal changes in foraging activity. A conceptual model suggests that contrasting resource acquisition modes may account for the evolution and maintenance of alternative predator avoidance syndromes along a continuum from Baetis (high mobility) to heptageniids (intermediate mobility) to Ephemerella (low mobility). Prey dispersal (swimming) to avoid capture results in reduction of otherwise high fecundity by Baetis, which trades off morphological defense for enhanced ability to acquire resources. Thus, improved foraging efficiency is the selection pressure maintaining the highly mobile life style in Baetis, which increases resource acquisition and fecundity, offsetting the high mortality costs associated with this behavior.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,CRESTED BUTTE,CO 81224","Peckarsky, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",121,39,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1996,77,"6",NA,NA,NA,1888,"1905",NA,"10.2307/2265792",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I tested the degree to which the variance in local insect variables (species richness, ratio of specialist to generalist chewers, abundance, and biomass) for leaf chewers associated with different species of tropical trees was accounted for by local and regional host-related variables, and by local abundance of potential enemies. Leaf-chewing insects feeding externally on ten species of forest trees were collected over a 1-yr field study in a submontane area in Papua New Guinea. The tree species were taxonomically distant, and the list included species of different successional status, different patterns of leaf production, and different heights. The affinity of chewing insects with particular tree species was ascertained by feeding trials in the laboratory. Local insect species richness varied greatly among tree species, by more than four-fold between the poorest (18 species) and the richest (94 species) tree species. The proportion of specialist insect species associated with particular tree species was significantly different among tree species and ranged from 16 to 72%. Trees supporting a rich fauna usually also supported a high proportion of specialists. The abundance and biomass of leaf-chewing insects per host species was difficult to predict. However, path analyses showed that most of the causal variance in insect species richness and in the ratio of specialist to generalist chewers was accounted for by five properties of the tree species: numbers of young leaves available throughout the year, ant (i.e., enemy) abundance, leaf palatability, leaf water content, and altitudinal range. Most of the variation in local species richness could be predicted from local processes (i.e., food resources and abundance of enemies), not from regional processes. This study and others suggest that in complex environments, such as tropical rain forests, local processes may be comparatively more important in maintaining the local species richness of insect herbivores than in less complex ones, such as temperate woodlands. The implications of these findings are evident: the effects of moderate habitat fragmentation and ecological stress may be more pronounced in tropical systems than in temperate systems and may result in a greater proportional loss of local biodiversity in the former.","BERNICE P BISHOP MUSEUM,DEPT NAT SCI,HONOLULU,HI 96817",NA,75,19,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1996,77,"6",NA,NA,NA,1906,"1919",NA,"10.2307/2265793",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I found that, although adult populations reflected well the most recent recruitment pulse for the two most common species, adult population growth rate was the most sensitive to changes in survivorship rates. Similarly, analyses of the effect that variance in each demographic parameter had on variability in subsequent adult population size also showed a disproportionate effect of adult survivorship on adult population sizes. In other words, high variability in a demographic estimate did not always result in high variability in population size. Negative density dependence was documented for all species, suggesting that recruitment effects are dampened by postrecruitment events. Thus, although recruitment events could be detected in the adult population for short time periods, postrecruitment events appeared to dampen the effects of seasonal recruitment pulses in these nearshore fishes.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195",NA,37,4,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1996,77,"6",NA,NA,NA,1928,"1941",NA,"10.2307/2265795",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Any one species can evolve in response to direct interactions with other species by changing its ''response'' to the presence of the other species or changing its ''effect'' on the species. We argue that the direction (positive or negative) of the direct and indirect effects will determine whether traits related to ''response'' or ''effect'' are most likely to be subject to natural selection.

The utility of morphological variables as ecological indicators depends upon our understanding of how the variable affects the ability of the organism to perform a particular task. Functional morphological analyses identify those features that can be directly related to behavioral performance and help to distinguish causal functional relationships from spurious correlations. The behavioral abilities of the individual, in turn, shape patterns of resource use and fitness by placing limits on the range of resources that can be utilized and by shaping the cost/benefit curve for resource choices. Examples from research on the feeding biology of North American sunfishes are discussed to illustrate how functional morphology can be used to provide explanations for differences between species in patterns of prey use, patterns of habitat use, ontogenetic diet switches, and population size. Trends from analyses of the evolution of fish feeding mechanisms suggest specific functional features that are most likely to vary among taxa and underlie differences in feeding performance and diet. Included in this group of predictive variables are the organization of lever arms in the jaw opening and closing systems, the size of the mouth, and the size of muscles used in prey-crushing behaviors.

Parasitic plants obtain water, sugar, nitrogen compounds, and a variety of secondary metabolites from their host plants. In a greenhouse study, I examined the direct interactions of a parasitic plant, Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), with three plant hosts and the indirect effects of this parasitism on the performance of a parasite-feeding herbivore. The three host species, Lupinus arboreus, Artemisia pycnocephala, and Eriophyllum staechadifolium, directly and differentially affected C. wightii flower production, although parasite biomass was not affected by host species. Surprisingly, parasite performance was weakest when attacking a leguminous host, although parasite total nitrogen was highest when growing on a legume. Parasites also exerted a strong direct effect on host performance: host dry mass was negatively correlated with parasite mass for all three host species tested. However, this effect differed among hosts: for E. staechadifolium, proportionately larger parasite mass was correlated with smaller overall biomass of the host and parasite combined, while for the other two hosts, overall host-parasite mass was not correlated with parasite mass, indicating that E. staechadifolium was more affected by parasite attack than were the other host species. Finally, host plant chemistry had strong indirect effects on the performance of an aphid, Nearctaphis kachena, that feeds on C. wightii. Aphids feeding on C. wightii that were parasitizing L. arboreus (alkaloid-producing, high nitrogen), A. pycnocephala (alkaloid-free, intermediate nitrogen), and E. staechadifolium (terpenoid-producing, low nitrogen) experienced 68.2, 65.3, and 49.5% survival, respectively. Further, aphids feeding on parasites using L. arboreus and A. pycnocephala produced 2.43 and 1.77 times more offspring on average than those feeding on parasites using E. staechadifolium.

Cuscuta was common in the middle marsh zones. The abundance of Cuscuta was positively correlated with the abundance of Limonium californicum at two sampling scales (0.25- and approximate to 40-m(2) quadrats). Sampling at the scale of individual plants indicated that the dominant plant in the marsh, Salicornia virginica, was preferred by Cuscuta as a host over Arthrocnemum subterminale, Limonium californicum, and Frankenia salina. This result was confirmed with host-choice experiments in the field. Based on spatial correlations and host-choice experiments, we hypothesized that Cuscuta indirectly facilitated Limonium and Frankenia, increasing plant diversity and initiating vegetation cycles. This hypothesis was supported by sampling patches with different histories of Cuscuta infection. Patches with recent heavy Cuscuta infection had reduced Salicornia biomass and increased Limonium and Frankenia biomass relative to controls. This effect was most pronounced at higher elevations and in larger, older patches. The hypothesis was also supported by sampling permanent quadrats repeatedly over time. The probability that Cuscuta would invade a quadrat increased with increasing cover of Salicornia. Quadrats containing Cuscuta increased in Limonium and Frankenia cover between censuses relative to quadrats lacking Cuscuta.

The rate of body growth was most rapid in the northern study area with the best summer ranges. Lowest body growth occurred in the population living under the poorest winter conditions. After snow-free winters the rate of body growth increased substantially, leading to large annual variations in yearling body masses. These differences in growth lead to significant age-specific differences between populations in female carcass masses in autumn. Probability of maturing as a yearling increased with body mass in the three southern populations. In contrast, in the northern study area no such relationship was found, leading to a delayed age at maturity in the population with the largest females. This shows that the relationship between age at maturity and body mass differs regionally, suggesting different selective regimes. The peak timing of ovulation of old females in the autumn showed a latitudinal delay. Females in the alpine population, with the poorest winter conditions, had significantly later mean calving dates and produced fewest calves per year. Gestation length appears to be dependent on nutritional condition of females during pregnancy. Mortality was highest in the northern study area where most of the deaths occurred during the summer. Very few calves died during the winter. These results suggest that a stable high-density equilibrium between moose and their food resources as expected from the food limitation hypothesis is unlikely. The decrease in fecundity and the increase in mortality under poor nutritional conditions during the winter has only a small effect on the population growth rate and is therefore unlikely to have a strong regulatory effect. In the absence of large predators, this will lead to large fluctuations in population size that will overshoot the carrying capacity.","AGR UNIV NORWAY, DEPT BIOL & NAT CONSERVAT, N-1432 AS, NORWAY",NA,101,52,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1996,77,"5",NA,NA,NA,1493,"1500",NA,"10.2307/2265546",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The purpose of my study was to investigate experimentally the differential and/or interactive effects of two predator guilds on herbivore densities. I performed my experiments on 24 creosotebushes at each of three sites within the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research Site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, USA. At each site the experiment consisted of: six creosotebushes from which birds were excluded with nylon mesh cages; six creosotebushes from which arthropod predators were removed by hand or aspirator; six creosotebushes from which both birds and arthropod predators were removed; and six control creosotebushes from which neither birds nor arthropod predators were removed. I conducted nondestructive nocturnal visual censuses of herbivores on each creosotebush at the beginning of the experiments in mid-May, 6 wk after the start of the experiment in late June, and 12 wk after the start of the experiment in early August. I conducted these experiments and censuses in 1993 and again in 1994. In both years the herbivore densities became significantly higher in experimental than in control creosotebushes. The effects of bird and arthropod predation on herbivore densities were additive in 1993, but they were compensatory in 1994. In 1994 arthropod predator densities became lower in creosotebushes from which birds had been removed than in creosotebushes from which birds had not been removed, but this result did not obtain in 1993. These results may be due to a combination of factors including: avian and arthropod predation on herbivores, ''intraguild'' predation of birds on arthropod predators, and competition within the herbivore community. The relative numerical impacts of the predator-removal experiments varied among seasons and among sites within either year, but temporal and spatial variation in predator impacts did not correlate strongly with known gradients of climatic or bottom-up heterogeneity in this system. The results of this study confirm the important direct and cumulative effects of multiple predator guilds, even against a complex background of temporal and spatial heterogeneity.","PENN STATE UNIV,PESTICIDE RES LAB,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802",NA,47,21,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1996,77,"5",NA,NA,NA,1544,"1555",NA,"10.2307/2265550",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The Red Queen hypothesis suggests that parasites provide a selective advantage to host sexual recombination sufficient to explain its persistence despite the twofold advantage of asexual reproduction. The constant production of resistant host genotypes by sexual recombination favors parasite genotypes that can overcome host resistance, resulting in a coevolutionary ''arms race.'' Systemic fungal parasites differ from nonsystemic fungi in ways that affect plant-pathogen interactions. Many systemic fungal parasites castrate their host plants, which reduces the potential for production of genetically variable, resistant progeny. Moreover, host genotypes susceptible to infection by the maternal pathogen are perpetuated through parasite-induced asexual reproduction or enforced selfing. Grasses in the genus Danthonia infected by Atkinsonella hypoxylon represent a model system for investigating evolution and stasis in plant-pathogen associations. Infected plants, unlike uninfected plants, reproduce only by self-fertilized seed through which the fungus is vertically transmitted.

Major factors include direct competition within host plants, direct competition within vectors, differences in transmission rates, and virus influences on vector behavior and population dynamics. The aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs), which infect a broad range of grasses worldwide, represent a model system for addressing questions about the outcome of direct and indirect competition between viruses. Historical shifts in the relative prevalence of BYDV strains document the apparent displacement of one virus strain (PAV) by another (MAV) over 20 yr. In the barley yellow dwarf system, transmission rate appears td play an important role in determining the outcome of competition between viruses. Moreover, the interaction between transmission rate and vector behavior may be particularly important. PAV is the stronger competitor within hosts, where double infections occur more often than in insect vectors. PAV also has significant advantages due to higher overall transmission rates than MAV.

Spatial organization of the host and pathogen populations then may be critical in determining patterns of disease occurrence and dynamics. We discuss three fundamental problems associated with understanding the interactions of plants, pathogens, and spatial structure: (1) how one characterizes spatial patterns, (2) how we determine spatial dynamic processes from a given spatial pattern, and (3) how we then simulate the spatial dynamics presumed to be dominating a given host-pathogen interaction. To demonstrate methods for the characterization of spatial pattern, we analyzed spatial maps of a Silene latifolia population infected with the anther smut Microbotryum violaceum, using join-count statistics, continuous spatial autocorrelation, and Mantel's test. Different statistical techniques provided different interpretations of the same data set, indicating the value of using multiple methods. We described spatial structure in the plant population, the pathogen population (factoring out the plant population structure), and spatial cross correlation between two variables (plant gender and disease status). Each of these tests provides information on how the disease may be spreading in the population. We are not very optimistic about the prospect of determining underlying disease-spread processes purely from analysis of spatial pattern. Most spatial patterns can potentially be generated by a number of biological processes (e.g., ''true'' vs. ''apparent'' contagion), and it is not possible to distinguish between hypotheses without additional information about the system. A difficulty in modeling spatial processes is simulation of populations with given spatial patterns. Simulated spatially structured populations are useful for predicting disease dynamics in a spatial context.

This paper provides a brief introduction to the ecology and epidemiology of brucellosis in Yellowstone National Park. Observed patterns of infection for brucellosis in bison in national parks in the United States suggest that Brucella has a relatively sharply defined threshold for establishment and that the proportion of the host population infected increases as a relatively simple function of population density, Unfortunately, the threshold population for Brucella establishment in bison is low, a herd of at feast 200 individuals; this makes it very hard to eradicate Brucella from wild populations. Simple calculations based on observed prevalence and recruitment data for the Yellowstone bison herd suggest that unacceptably high levels of culling would be required to eradicate brucellosis in the park. A simple mathematical model is used to describe aspects of the population dynamics of Brucella. The analyses suggest that an understanding of infectious disease dynamics is crucial to the management and conservation of wild and domestic ungulate species in and around national parks and other nature reserves. The consequences of disease control for the maintenance of biodiversity in other natural and captive communities need to be better understood.","NATL BIOL SERV, MIDCONTINENT ECOL CTR, GREATER YELLOWSTONE FIELD STN, YELLOWSTONE NATL PK, WY 82190 USA","Dobson, A (corresponding author), PRINCETON UNIV, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA.",140,76,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1996,77,"4",NA,NA,NA,1026,"1036",NA,"10.2307/2265573",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We examined the effects of three tomato allelochemicals (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21 degrees:10 degrees C and 26 degrees:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer respectively) on three insect herbivores: a Solanaceae specialist, Manduca sexta, and the polyphagous Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera exigua. The alkaloid tomatine slowed development of the polyphagous N. tea, but the two phenolics had little effect. Development of the polyphagous S. exigua was faster with tomatine at the cool thermal regime, and slower with the two phenolics together at the warm thermal regime. All three of the tomato allelochemicals slowed development of the specialist M. sexta. Values of approximate digestibility (or assimilation efficiency) for the two polyphagous species spanned a range twice that of the Solanaceae specialist, increasing when allelochemicals were added to diet. Our techniques permitted us to separate pre- and post-ingestive effects of allelochemicals on mass gained, but we found complex interaction of allelochemicals and of temperature and allelochemicals. The effects of an allelochemical on larval performance often depended on the combination of other allelochemicals in the diet. But the allelochemicals did not always have a negative effect, and multiple allelochemicals did not always have a more negative effect than a single allelochemical. Interaction between thermal regime and the allelochemicals was also common. For example, whether rutin had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on relative growth rare of S. exigua depended on thermal regime and presence or absence of chlorogenic acid. Often the negative effect of an allelochemical was greater at the warm regime than at the cool regime, but not consistently so. Another experiment showed that thermal regime did not affect allelochemical concentration in the diets. Over time (7 d), only tomatine concentration declined. Therefore, the interactive effects of thermal regime and allelochemicals on the insect herbivores were not an artifact of the experimental procedures. Overall, the results indicated that insect performance is not a simple function of temperature and food quality because interactions occur between these factors. They also suggest that the array of chemical defenses exhibited by a particular plant species may be shaped in part by temperature altering the efficacy of allelochemicals.",NA,"Stamp, NE (corresponding author), SUNY BINGHAMTON,DEPT BIOL SCI,BINGHAMTON UNIV,BINGHAMTON,NY 13902, USA.",78,22,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1996,77,"4",NA,NA,NA,1088,"1102",NA,"10.2307/2265578",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

P. algirus mainly inhabits broad-leaved forests, whereas A. erythrurus prefers open, sandy areas with sparsely distributed vegetation. These habitat preferences parallel differences between the areas in which both genera presumably originated: Eurosaharian xeric steppes with high operative temperatures (T-e) for Acanthodactylus, and Mediterranean open forests with lower T-e for Psammodromus. Field observations showed that percentage of time spent basking and basking rate (number of basks per minute) were negatively related to T-e, although average bask duration was not. Percentage of time spent moving, moving rate (number of moves per minute), and the average duration of individual moves were inversely related to T-e and were higher in P. algirus. The percentage of total locomotion time that was spent moving in the shade was also higher in P. algirus. Behavioral thermoregulation strategies differed in a laboratory thermogradient, where P. algirus basked more often and for shorter periods and selected warmer patches than did A. erythrurus. Selected body temperatures (T-b) in a laboratory thermogradient were significantly higher in A. erythrurus than in P. algirus.

Our data support the existence of a complex syndrome that combines aspects of the behavior, physiology, and ecology of both species. The thermal consequences of inhabiting a certain type of habitat can be counterbalanced by behavioral and physiological means that, in turn, affect movement and, hence, foraging behavior.

As a multiple of BMR it was independent of sex, wing length, body mass, mass change, and duration of the period at sea, but was strongly dependent on wind speed, being higher during slack winds. There was also a trend for higher wingbeat frequency at winds too low for sustained dynamic soaring.

In particular, habitat patches that survive the process of fragmentation become increasingly isolated from one another, and this can cause species' declines in excess of predictions based strictly on reductions in habitat area. To quantify the hindrance of-dispersal caused by habitat fragmentation, landscape ecologists have invented the notion of habitat connectivity. Indices of landscape pattern are frequently used to estimate habitat connectivity, but whether they actually do so remains undocumented. If indices of habitat pattern do indeed estimate habitat connectivity, then these indices should correlate well with predictions of dispersal success. To test this possibility, I looked for correlations between nine common indices of habitat pattern and the results of a simulated dispersal process conducted using GIS data on the distribution of old-growth forest through the Pacific Northwest. The nine indices of habitat pattern that I examined were only weakly correlated with the results from the dispersal modeling, but I identified a new pattern index, termed patch cohesion, for which the fit was much better. Moreover, I found patch cohesion to be insensitive to the details and artifacts of the dispersal model.

Nitrogen pools in the rhizome and shoot were measured in fertilized and nonfertilized plants over two growing seasons (3-4 growing seasons after fertilization began). Fertilized plants stored more N in the rhizome throughout both seasons than did nonfertilized plants. Inflorescence, foliar, and preformed bud N concentrations and biomass production rate did not increase in response to fertilization. The increased storage of N without a concomitant influence on biomass production demonstrates that luxury uptake occurs in this species. Increased N storage in fertilized plants was accommodated by an increase in the amino acids arginine, the nonprotein amino a acid, delta-acetylornithine, glutamine, and glutamate. Luxury uptake was accommodated entirely through filling of existing rhizome cells; no increased cell proliferation was found. Sucrose concentration was significantly lower in the recently produced rhizome tissue of fertilized plants, possibly reflecting the carbon costs of storing the additional N. During the first half of the season, fertilized plants relied more on stored N to drive growth, with translocation from reserves accounting for 56% and 100% of the aboveground N requirement in nonfertilized and fertilized plants, respectively. In fertilized plants, the complete reliance on stored N indicates a decrease in current-season uptake of N during the period normally associated with net N uptake in this species. This is interpreted as either (1) a seasonal shift in N uptake, or (2) a negative feedback between stored N and uptake that would constrain the continued accumulation of excess N and eliminate any long-term benefits of luxury N uptake in this species.","UNIV COLORADO,INST ARCTIC & ALPINE RES,MT RES STN,BOULDER,CO 80309","Lipson, DA (corresponding author), UNIV COLORADO,DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGANISM BIOL,BOULDER,CO 80309, USA.",47,13,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1996,77,"4",NA,NA,NA,1277,"1285",NA,"10.2307/2265597",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Patterns observed in all deserts included: (1) low alpha diversity (2-4 species per site); (2) high beta diversity (species turnover between sites); and (3) local coexistence of 20-30% of the species in the regional pool. Additionally, the number of species with which a species co-occurred increased with the number of sites at which that species occurred. Although these results suggested that some features of community structure were similar across deserts, other aspects, especially trophic structure, differed widely. Deserts in the northern hemisphere possessed more granivores, and the Turkestan Desert more folivores, than other deserts. Carnivorous small mammals were most strongly represented in Australia, and omnivores in South America, Australia, and the Thar.

Steps in the assembly sequence that cannot be resolved by this method are determined by numerical integration. The results are as follows. (1) At each step in an assembly sequence, a species that succeeds in invading when rare persists in the resulting community even if one or more of the resident species becomes extinct. (2) Assembly sequences are terminated with a community that is uninvadable by any of the remaining species from the pool. The number of these endpoints is small, even when the species pool is large. (3) In some cases, the final community cannot be reassembled from the species left in it; other species, which are absent at the end, are needed for the endpoint to be reached.

Therefore, it is likely that small biological differences between species interact with habitat characteristics to produce distinct patterns of distribution and abundance throughout a new range. In this study we test the hypothesis that differences in the distribution and abundance of species sharing an identical set of ''ideal weed characteristics'' are explicable in terms of species-specific responses to environmental variation within their new range. Using multifactor experiments, we investigated some of the ecological interactions influencing reproductive success in two very closely related species of annuals having invaded the French Mediterranean region for >150 yr and showing marked differences in their local distribution and abundance patterns. We transplanted seedlings of Conyza canadensis (a species restricted to recently disturbed areas) and C. sumatrensis (a species colonizing early- to mid-successional old fields) at equal densities in three contrasting old fields (6 mo, 4 yr, 17-yr abandonment, respectively) during 1991-1992, a growing season with average rainfall. Individual performances (measured as survivorship, reproductive timing, and reproductive output) were evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbors (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) resource availability (tested with nutrient and water addition), and (3) herbivory (tested with chemical limitation). Manipulated factors interacted in a rather complex fashion to influence survivorship and reproduction in both species. However, patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across Mediterranean landscapes: C. sumatrensis performed better than C. canadensis in all fields, including the youngest one (6 mo old). Herbivory only slightly affected transplant performances. In contrast, competition with plant neighbors had substantial effects on either Conyza species and may be the most important determinant of performance in Mediterranean old fields. The experiment showed unambiguously that the two species differ markedly in their competitive ability, with C. sumatrensis performing better than C. canadensis in the presence of neighboring vegetation. In addition, C. sumatrensis displayed a superior ability to take up and/or to use water and nutrient resources when they become available in competitive environments. We argue that potential physiological or anatomical species differences responsible for this differential susceptibility to local resource reduction by neighbors could involve differences in constructional organization, leaf morphology, and reproductive phenologies.","CNRS,CTR ECOL FONCT & EVOLUT,F-34033 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE",NA,111,39,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1996,77,"3",NA,NA,NA,791,"804",NA,"10.2307/2265502",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The theory requires an estimation of a critical value of tree cover at which the woodlands switch abruptly from a fragmented collection of small patches of trees to a network of connected canopies. Presumably, this transition is associated with critical environmental conditions that regulate the ecologies of trees vs. grasses. We developed and tested a new method to estimate the critical cover value of woodlands on complex terrain. The method was based on multiscale assessments of the associations between local tree coverage and two types of patch edge. Tests on artificial gradient percolation maps revealed an interaction between the type of edge used (''hull edge,'' which is based on only the orthogonal connections between canopy-occupied cells, vs. ''accessible edge,'' which is based on both orthogonal and diagonal connections beween canopy-occupied cells) and the neighborhood rule used to define a cluster (von Neumann 5-cell or Moore 9-cell). When applied to digitized, geographically referenced aerial photographs, the method indicated that areas less than or equal to 6.6 ha exhibited the theoretical critical value of 59.3% cover predicted for square lattices and the 5-cell neighborhood. Construction of both edge types on a given map can reveal locations of steep environmental gradients that may be buffered against modest climate fluctuations. The edges can be used in the calibration of independent variables to predict tree cover.

This study, in Caribbean Panama, examined whether a common territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, limits the abundances of adults of four ecologically similar congeners in S. planifrons' primary habitat: S. partitus and S. variabilis, which commonly occur in that habitat, and S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus, which rarely do. When S. planifrons was nearly eliminated from 16 natural patch reefs for 4-6 yr, adult populations of S. partitus, which is less aggressive and half the size of S. planifrons, doubled and expanded their range into a microhabitat previously used almost exclusively by adults of S. planifrons. Population increases by S. partitus occurred within 1 yr of the removal of S. planifrons, were persistent, but only reached their maximum approximate to 4 yr (and about four generations) after the initial removal. Adult populations of S. variabilis, which is less aggressive and 20% smaller than S. planifrons, also doubled following the removal of S. planifrons. Combined populations of S. partitus plus S. variabilis increased most on reefs where S. planifrons previously had been most dense. However, increases by those two species reached only approximate to 70% of the population density and approximate to 40% of the biomass density that S. planifrons had before the removals. Removal of S. planifrons had no effect on the abundances of S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus. Removal of S. partitus from eight reefs for 3 yr did not affect the abundances of S. planifrons or S. variabilis. Eleven years monitoring of adult populations and juvenile recruitment by S. partitus before and during the experiment show that its population increase after the removal of S. planifrons occurred while its overall abundance was gradually increasing, but was not associated with a period of unusually high juvenile recruitment. Thus asymmetric competition among closely related, ecologically similar, territorial coral reef fishes does sometimes control both abundances and microhabitat use in shared habitat. Interspecific territoriality and differences in body size and aggressiveness that lead to asymmetric competitive ability occur commonly among reef fishes in various trophic groups. Interspecific interactions within such groups of species often affect their patterns of habitat use.

Here, we emphasize the role that avian dispersers play as agents of mistletoe seed transmission to plant hosts. We describe the patterns of transmission of the seeds of Tristerix aphyllus, an endophytic Chilean mistletoe, on two of its columnar cacti hosts (Eulychnia acida and Echinopsis skottsbergii) by the Chilean Mockingbird Mimus thenca. In north-central Chile, these cacti grow in relatively discrete subpopulations on north-facing slopes. We measured variation in seed transmission within 10 subpopulations varying in species composition, host density, parasite density, parasite prevalence (defined as the percentage of hosts infested in a given population), and disperser abundance. Seed transmission was independent of species, but was strongly dependent on prior parasitism. Parasitized individuals received seeds much more frequently than expected from their relative abundance. We found no correlation between the density of hosts and seed transmission. We found strong positive correlations, however, between parasite prevalence and seed transmission to both parasitized and nonparasitized hosts. Seed transmission of T. aphyllus seeds by M. thenca appeared to be frequency- rather than density-dependent. Seed transmission was also tightly and positively correlated with the abundance of seed-dispersing birds at each site. Because bird abundance and parasite prevalence were correlated, we conducted path analysis to disentangle their relative effect on seed transmission. A model including only the direct effect of bird abundance and the indirect effect of parasite prevalence through bird abundance explained roughly the same variance as a full model including both the direct and indirect effects of bird abundance and prevalence on seed transmission. Apparently, variation in bird abundance was the main determinant of variation in transmission. We suggest that mistletoes, host plants, and the birds that disperse mistletoe seeds are systems well suited for studies of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of disease transmission.","UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, CTR ECOL, COYOACAN 04510, DF, MEXICO; UNIV CHILE, DEPT CIENCIAS ECOL, SANTIAGO, CHILE; PRINCETON UNIV, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, PRINCETON, NJ 08540 USA","DelRio, CM (corresponding author), UNIV WYOMING, DEPT ZOOL & PHYSIOL, POB 3166, LARAMIE, WY 82071 USA.",67,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1996,77,"3",NA,NA,NA,912,"921",NA,"10.2307/2265511",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We examined the fecundity of modules (polyps) and colonies of six reef-building corals (Acropora hyacinthus, A. nana, A. gemmifera, A. millepora, Goninstrea retiformis, and Stylophora pistillata) to explore how modularity influences reproductive strategies and the evolution of life histories in clonal animals. In unitary, aclonal organisms, fecundity often reaches a plateau or declines in old age. In contrast, we found that fecundity of colonies was indeterminate because vegetative growth can lead to an indefinite number of repeated, reproductive modules. However, colony fecundity was not a simple linear function of the number of modules. The species ranking of polyp fecundities (G. retiformis > the Acropora species > S. pistillata) was very different from the ranks of size-specific colony fecundities (A. hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. gemmifera > A. nana and G. retiformis). Colony fecundity for small S. pistillata was the lowest of all, but large colonies were more fecund than any of the other species at a comparable colony size (despite Stylophora having the lowest polyp fecundity). This contrast highlights clearly the effects of modularity on the reproductive biology and life histories of clonal organisms. The volume of eggs and testes, and the number of eggs and testes per polyp varied greatly among species (20-, 13-, 17-, and 3-fold, respectively). Egg volume was smallest for S. pistillata (the only brooder in the study) and for G. retiformis (which also had the most eggs per polyp, indicating a trade-off between egg size and number). The total reproductive volume per polyp (egg and testes combined) varied three-fold among the six species, and was correlated with a similar range of polyp diameters. In some cases, components of polyp fecundity depended on colony size; egg size in A. hyacinthus and A. nana and the number of planulae per polyp in S. pistillata increased by two- to fourfold with a one to two order of magnitude change in colony size. However, egg size was constant for the other species. Similarly, colony size had no effect on egg or testes number per polyp or testes volume per polyp for any species. We also found striking differences in sex allocation, which may relate to the fertilization biology of these hermaphroditic species. The ratio of total egg volume to testes volume per polyp varied fivefold, and was lowest for S. pistillata (a brooder) and G. retiformis (which produced the most and smallest eggs). The ratio increased with colony size for all species, especially A. hyacinthus. An early investment predominantly in testes allows sex to commence without the initial expense of egg production, perhaps so that colony growth can continue to a larger, safer size. All species had a characteristic colony size at maturation, which varied ninefold among taxa, corresponding to a minimum puberty age of 1-3 yr. This is the first comparative study to simultaneously measure male and female function in a range of clonal animals.","JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND, DEPT MARINE BIOL, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA",NA,227,99,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1996,77,"3",NA,NA,NA,950,"963",NA,"10.2307/2265514",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The distribution of species within the resulting mosaic depends upon an interaction between species' life history traits and the spatial and temporal structure of the ecological processes controlling species' distributions. We have used a spatially explicit simulation model (JASPER) Of a serpentine grassland to examine the importance of some of these relationships, focusing primarily on the role of disturbance. The model JASPER is hierarchical in design and was developed to simulate the population dynamics of three interacting plant species: Bromus mollis, Calycadenia multiglandulosa, and Plantago erecta. Population dynamics were modeled as occurring within local sites, which were then arranged in a square array to form a landscape. Connections among sites within a landscape were made primarily through seed dispersal. Several components of disturbance architecture were varied systematically among model runs to determine their impact on population dynamics at the scale of the landscape. We considered three levels of organization in modeling disturbance: (1) overall rate of disturbance, (2) size of individual disturbances, and (3) temporal and spatial autocorrelation among individual disturbances. The results demonstrate that the impact of disturbance depends upon a complex interaction between the life history characteristics of the species making up the community and the spatial and temporal structure of the disturbance regime. For example, we found that the biggest impact on species abundance occurred in response to a shift in the temporal autocorrelation structure of the disturbance regime. Also, species diversity was found to increase at intermediate levels of disturbance (as has been shown in several other studies). However, what can be considered an intermediate level of disturbance depends as much upon the temporal autocorrelation structure of the disturbance regime as it does upon the absolute rate of disturbance. These results suggest that predicting the impact of disturbance on ecological communities will require an explicit understanding of at least some aspects of the spatial and temporal architecture of the disturbance regime.","PRINCETON UNIV,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL,PRINCETON,NJ 08544","Moloney, KA (corresponding author), IOWA STATE UNIV,DEPT BOT,143 BASSEY HALL,AMES,IA 50011, USA.",186,52,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1996,77,"2",NA,NA,NA,375,"394",NA,"10.2307/2265616",20,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We studied disappearance of Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during four breeding seasons in a woodland area in Norway provided with nest boxes. The main cause of disappearance was probably predation by the European Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Disappearance was nonsignificantly higher in females (10% per season, n = 305) than in males (7% per season, n = 269). Female disappearance peaked during egg-laying (0.53% per day), but was also high during the nest-building (0.42% per day) and nestling (0.36% per day) stages. It was low during incubation (0.05% per day), probably because less time was spent outside the nest. Low risk of predation during incubation may help to explain why female body mass remains high during this stage of breeding but drops soon after hatching. Females with selected flight feathers experimentally removed to simulate molt suffered a much higher disappearance per season (24%, n = 109) than did control females (10%, n = 305). This may help to explain why breeding and molt usually are temporally segregated activities in birds. Variation in female body mass and size (wing length, tarsus length), age, previous breeding experience, mating date, laying date, clutch size, and mating status could not account for the variation found in female disappearance. Disappearance was lower in males than in females during the nest-building period, despite the more conspicuous plumage color of males. This may be explained by the fact that only the female builds the nest. We suggest that risk of predation is an important constraint on sexual selection of male plumage color in species in which males take part in nest building.",NA,"Slagsvold, T (corresponding author), UNIV OSLO,DEPT BIOL,POB 1050,N-0316 OSLO,NORWAY.",93,15,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1996,77,"2",NA,NA,NA,461,"471",NA,"10.2307/2265622",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Following the exceptionally severe El Nino event of 1982-1983, hybrids survived as well as, and in some cases better than, the parental species during dry seasons of potential food limitation. They also backcrossed to two of the parental species. This study was undertaken to compare the diets of hybrids with the diets of the parental species in order to assess possible reasons for the high hybrid survival. Diets of F-1 hybrids and first generation backcrosses to G. fortis were intermediate between the diets of the respective parental species. Distinctiveness of the hybrid diets was most pronounced where the diets of the parental species differed most. A strong determinant was beak morphology; hybrids inherit beak traits from both parents, and, on average, have intermediate beak sizes. Among the combined groups of species and hybrids, and among the hybrids alone, dietary characteristics covaried with beak morphology. Hybrids that differ most from G. fortis in beak morphology, the G. fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrids, experience a feeding efficiency advantage when feeding on Opuntia echios seeds, commonly consumed in the dry season. These findings are used to interpret the higher survival of hybrids after 1983 than beforehand. The El Nino event that year led to an enduring (10-yr) change in the habitat and plant composition of the island. A decrease in absolute and relative abundance of large and hard seeds apparently caused relatively high mortality among G. scandens and the largest G. fortis individuals. Hybrids were favored by an abundance of small seeds. The high survival of G. fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrids may have been due, additionally, to a broad diet and to efficient exploitation of Opuntia seeds.

In Slatkin's pioneering model (Slatkin 1980), the genetics of the quantitative character determining the competitive interactions are modeled by assuming that the character is normally distributed in each generation. Only the mean and the variance of the character distributions change over time. With symmetric ecological assumptions for the two competing species, and with normally distributed resources that are equally used by both species, this model did not yield significant displacement. This has led to the belief that ecological asymmetries or constraints on resource use, e.g., by constraining the phenotypic variances, are necessary for character displacement. I argue that the reason for the negative result in Slatkin's original model is that the genetics are modeled too rigidly. With a more flexible genetic model, obtained by explicitly modeling many loci with additive effects, character displacement occurs as a rule even for symmetric ecological assumptions and without constraints on the phenotype distributions. The model can also be used in other contexts than competition for resources. For example, character displacement in a host-parasite system can lead to parasite specialization. The results suggest that more detailed genetic models yield a finer resolution of the interaction between population genetics and ecological dynamics.

As a result, pollen is often transferred among heterospecific flowers. The ''Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,'' a paradigm of pollination ecology and angiosperm evolution, suggests that the severity of such interspecific pollen transfer should reflect the similarity in the architecture of sexual structures (specifically, placement of stigma and anthers) among the flowers involved. We evaluated the hypothesis with six species of Costa Rican cloud-forest plants varying greatly in sexual architecture but all pollinated by the same hummingbird, Lampornis calolaema. Captive Lampornis visited five long-styled, ''pollen-donor'' flowers of distylous, self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), then 20 short-styled recipient flowers of Palicourea, with or without five flowers of a second species intervening. We assessed intraspecific pollen transfer from Palicourea donors by counting pollen tubes in styles of the recipients. We examined interspecific pollen transfer between Palicourea and each of the five other species by counting heterospecific grains deposited on stigmas of Palicourea recipients, and Palicourea grains deposited on stigmas and anthers of the heterospecific flowers. In a separate experiment, we examined how mixed-species flower visits modified the pollen loads actually carried by birds. Results did not uphold the Sexual Architecture Hypothesis. A single visit to any heterospecific flower greatly affected the hummingbird's prior load of Palicourea pollen, regardless of where the second species placed its own pollen on the bird. Interspecific pollen transfer occurred consistently, but (1) heterospecific grains usurped little space on stigmas of Palicourea recipients and had no discernible effect on pollen-tube growth, whereas (2) few Palicourea grains landed specifically on anthers and stigmas of heterospecific flowers. Instead, numerous Palicourea grains apparently were scraped off on other floral structures such as the corolla. Consequently, every species of intervening flowers, regardless of its sexual architecture per se, strongly reduced pollen transfer from donor to recipient Palicourea flowers, on average by 76%. In fact, the most drastic reductions resulted from the two species whose sexual architectures least resembled that of Palicourea. Results imply that ''pollen scraping'' by floral structures other than anthers and stigmas may be important and widespread among some animal-pollinated flowers. Thus, except in cases where no other floral structures contact pollinators, the positions of anthers and stigmas alone may have little bearing on the severity of interspecific pollen transfer and competitive interactions among plants sharing pollinators.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT ZOOL,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611","Murcia, C (corresponding author), WILDLIFE CONSERVAT SOC,APARTADO AEREO 25527,CALI,COLOMBIA.",81,29,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1996,77,"2",NA,NA,NA,550,"560",NA,"10.2307/2265629",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In describing how the composition of a tropical forest would change over many tree generations in the absence of density dependence, Hubbell's model, as presented, is untestable. However, by substituting space for time, it can be tested. Here we take advantage of the meandering of the Manu River to generate independently replicated, primary-successional chronosequences which culminate in tall, ''mature-phase'' forests possessing a characteristic complex vertical structure. By the logic of the nonequilibrium hypothesis, spatially uncorrelated forests should show uncorrelated species abundances. We tested this prediction by examining the compositional similarity of 1000-tree samples in four types of comparisons: (1) between nearby (potentially spatially correlated) and remote (presumably uncorrelated) plots of mature floodplain forest, (2) between real and synthetic forests generated by scrambling the relative abundances of the species, (3) between successional stages and the ''mature phase'' of floodplain forest, and (4) between mature floodplain forest and adjacent upland forest on a different soil type. In all comparisons, five mature floodplain-forest plots showed higher levels of similarity inter se than to any of the other real or synthetic forests. The 10 most abundant species in the three potentially spatially correlated plots appeared prominently in the 10 top ranks of two remote plots located 30 and 39 km to the east. The probability of obtaining the observed result under the expectation of the nonequilibrium hypothesis was approximate to 10(-7).

The four taxa with moderate-to-extreme shade tolerance varied considerably in responses of individual characters to R:FR and PPFD. The patterns of morphological responses to reduced PPFD and R:FR help explain how the shade tolerances of the seedlings of rain forest trees vary in a continuous manner. Recommendations concerning seedling shade tolerance for sylviculture or nursery practice may need revision if they were based on shade trials using spectrally neutral shade fabrics or slat houses.

We examined five species across a successional sere near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela, to test whether plasticity was associated with successional status and to determine whether changes in foliar properties during secondary succession can be attributed to shifts in species composition, in resource availability, or both. Average leaf N concentration was high (nearly 3%) for a pioneer species (Cecropia ficifolia) early in succession (1-3 yr after abandonment) but was always lower for the other early and mid- to-late succession species, especially later in succession (1-2% at 5-10 yr after abandonment). Net photosynthetic capacity (P-max/area and P-max/mass) varied as much as sixfold, being higher in pioneer species such as Cecropia and Vismia on recently abandoned sites and lower in late successional species such as Miconia and Licania on 10-yr abandoned agricultural sites. Total daily light availability also varied widely (14-fold) from its peak 1 yr after farm abandonment to low levels 9 yr into succession. During the first 5 yr of secondary succession, there were significant (P < 0.05) differences in P-max and leaf N concentration among species in any given year. In most species, P-max values declined with increasing time since abandonment within any given site. There were important differences in photosynthetic plasticity among species: P-max tended to be much greater in earlier than later successional species soon after abandonment. Also, the difference in P-max among species narrowed (or reversed) over time since abandonment, largely because of decreasing P-max in pioneer species. The results suggest that changes in both species composition and in resource availability combine to produce the common pattern of decreasing leaf N concentration and photosynthetic rates during early rain forest succession after agriculture. Early successional species showed strong (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.57, P = 0.0001) mass-based photosynthesis-N relationships but weak (r(2) = 0.40 or lower, P = 0.0001) area-based relationships both across the secondary successional sere after agriculture and across sites varying in types of disturbance. Both mass- and area-based photosynthesis-N relationships were poorer or not significant (P > 0.05) for mid- to late-successional species. Higher instantaneous P-max/N and greater slopes of the photosynthesis-N relationships in early than late successional species suggest that pioneer species may show greater carbon assimilation capacity with elevated leaf N concentration on early successional sites than co-occurring species. The data suggest that early and late successional species may differ in the mode and degree of leaf-level physiological plasticity across succession.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT FORESTRY, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT FOREST RESOURCES, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA",NA,82,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1996,77,"2",NA,NA,NA,581,"594",NA,"10.2307/2265632",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Green Published","2021-05-12"

Previous studies have suggested that Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) invaded aquatic habitats with large dragonflies as the top predators at least twice, and large changes in morphological structures (e.g., caudal lamellae acid abdomen), which should increase swimming speed, are associated with these invasions. This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of Felsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and log(e)(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes, than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation. The results of this study indicate that the change in selective environment associated with habitat shifts into dragonfly lakes promoted adaptations for increased swimming speed in Enallagma lineages. The potential ramifications of this adaptation for community structure are discussed.","BUCKNELL UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LEWISBURG, PA 17837 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",111,54,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1996,77,"2",NA,NA,NA,617,"629",NA,"10.2307/2265635",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Growing concern for the cumulative influence of land use activities on ecological systems has heightened the need for large-scale studies to complement what has been observed at local scales. We investigated possible landscape effects on Neotropical migrant bird populations for the eastern United States by linking two large-scale inventories designed to monitor breeding-bird abundances and land use patterns. The null hypothesis of no relation between landscape structure and Neotropical migrant abundance was tested by correlating measures of landscape structure with bird abundance, while controlling for the geographic distance among samples. Neotropical migrants as a group were more ''sensitive'' to landscape structure than either temperate migrants or permanent residents. Neotropical migrants tended to be more abundant in landscapes with a greater proportion of forest and wetland habitats, fewer edge habitats, larger forest patches, and with forest habitats well dispersed throughout the scene. Permanent residents showed few correlations with landscape structure and temperate migrants were associated with habitat diversity and edge attributes rather than with the amount, size, and dispersion of forest habitats. The association between Neotropical migrant abundance and forest fragmentation differed among physiographic strata, suggesting that landscape context affects observed relations between bird abundance and landscape structure. Finally, associations between landscape structure and temporal trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were counter to those observed in space. Trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were negatively correlated with forest habitats. These results suggest that extrapolation of patterns observed in some landscapes is not likely to hold regionally, and that conservation policies must consider the variation in landscape structure associations observed among different types of bird species and in physiographic strata with varying land use histories.","NATL BIOL SERV,PATUXENT ENVIRONM SCI CTR,LAUREL,MD 20708","Flather, CH (corresponding author), US FOREST SERV,ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPT STN,FT COLLINS,CO 80526, USA.",194,41,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,28,"35",NA,"10.2307/2265651",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Preferred pathways for dispersal (i.e., corridors), as well as dispersal barriers, are difficult to identify when the landscape matrix is composed of a complex mixture of land cover types. We developed an individual-based dispersal model to measure immigration and emigration rates between habitat islands within heterogeneous landscapes. Dispersing individuals of a model organism were simulated as self-avoiding random walkers (SAW) traversing a digital land cover map, with each habitat type assigned a priori a probability that the SAW would enter that habitat type. Each individual began the dispersal process on a random site at the edge of a deciduous forest patch and was allowed to move until it reached a different deciduous forest patch. Visualization of the movement patterns across the landscape was achieved by tabulating the frequency of visitation of successful dispersers to each grid cell on the map. The model was used to estimate the probabilities of disperser transfer between patches by varying the a priori probabilities of movement into each habitat type in order to: (1) estimate the effect of changing landscape heterogeneity on the transfer probabilities, and (2) visualize dispersal corridors and barriers as perceived by model organisms operating by specific movement rules and at specific scales. The results show that 89% of the variability in dispersal success can be accounted for by differences in the size and isolation of forest patches, with closer and larger patches having significantly greater exchange of dispersing organisms. However, changes in the heterogeneity of the landscape matrix could significantly enhance or decrease emigration success from an individual patch, depending on the landscape. Changes in emigration success from an individual patch resulting from changes in matrix heterogeneity were not predictable, and transfer rates between patches were not symmetrical due to differences in the proximity of neighboring patches, and differences in the funneling attributes of certain landscape patterns. Visualizations showed that corridors are often diffuse and difficult to identify from structural features of the landscape. A wide range of organisms with differing movement capabilities can be simulated using the approach presented to increase our understanding of how landscape structure affects organism dispersal.","OAK RIDGE NATL LAB, DIV ENVIRONM SCI, OAK RIDGE, TN 37831 USA","Gustafson, EJ (corresponding author), US FOREST SERV, N CENT FOREST EXPT STN, FORESTRY SCI LAB, RHINELANDER, WI 54501 USA.",352,120,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,94,"107",NA,"10.2307/2265659",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In this paper, we examine the impact of history on the species composition of intertidal reef corals, by comparing simulation models that incorporate four different levels of knowledge about the recent past (over a time scale of 1-27 yr). The models are Markov or semi-Markov transition probability matrix models, based on rates of colonization, persistence, and species replacement measured from a long-term study spanning three decades at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Rates of colonization (transitions from free space) varied 20-fold for different species groups, while mortality (transitions to free space) ranged fivefold, reflecting a wide range of life histories among the coral assemblage. Virtually all species groups could undergo reciprocal transitions (e.g., from A to B, and B to A) in a single time interval, indicating the lack of a single competitive dominant that was capable of outcompeting all or most other species. Transition probabilities changed markedly as a function of history. For most species groups, the probability of persisting (i.e., ''transitions'' from A to A) increased with time. Thus, a colony that had occupied space for some time was generally more likely to continue to do so than a new arrival. This result is consistent with an escape in size for older colonies from mortality agents such as competition and predation. However, three species groups showed the opposite pattern. Algae, Pocilloporid corals, and fragile tabular Acroporn showed marked increases in transitions to free space after 3-5 yr, reflecting a more ephemeral suite of life history traits. Similarly, free space that had recently been generated had a higher rate of colonization than substratum that had been unoccupied for some time. These results falsify a major assumption of standard first-order models, i.e., that transition probabilities are constant, and that history is irrelevant. Although the changes in transition probabilities as a function of history were often striking, the four different models we employed show only minor variation in community composition in both transitory and climax (equilibrium) phases. Thus, while recent history was important in determining transition probabilities, it had little effect on community dynamics and structure in this system. This discrepancy is due to the rapid turnover of corals and algae on shallow reef crests, where only a small proportion of colonies survive long enough to display effects of history. All models agreed that the length of time required for this system to reach an equilibrium community structure is far longer than the observed interval between recurrent disturbances from tropical cyclones.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106","Tanner, JE (corresponding author), JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND,DEPT MARINE BIOL,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4811,AUSTRALIA.",70,29,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,108,"117",NA,"10.2307/2265660",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, DEPT BIOL 0116, LA JOLLA, CA 92117 USA",NA,233,80,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,118,"132",NA,"10.2307/2265661",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax. Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this system, and we discuss the implications of such behavioral indirect effects in the study of ecological communities; Our results also illustrate the futility of attempting to partition the effects of competitors and predators, as both competitors and the non-lethal presence of predators significantly affected growth rates and death by starvation of small larvae. Finally, our results illustrate how individual behavioral responses may be translated to community and ecosystem properties.","UNIV TORONTO,ERINDALE COLL,DEPT ZOOL,MISSISSAUGA,ON L5L 1C6,CANADA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,NAT SCI BLDG,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",279,77,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,157,"169",NA,"10.2307/2265664",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Condition factor was estimated using somatic lipid content, while growth rate was determined from scale measurements. Fish with extreme benthic and limnetic morphologies are on average superior to fish with intermediate morphologies, especially in the pelagic habitat.

Consequently, overall population dynamics are affected both by processes operating within individual stages and by factors that influence transitions between stages. In largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), there is a diet shift from littoral invertebrates to fish that typically occurs sometime in their 1st yr. I examined factors that influenced this shift by tracking diet and growth trajectories of young-of-year (YOY) bass cohorts in several Michigan lakes over 2 yr. Cohorts differed in consumption rates of invertebrate prey, which led to an early divergence in bass growth among lakes. This variation in early growth had dramatic consequences for the timing of the shift to piscivory. In lakes with rapid growth in the invertebrate feeding stage, bass were able to gain a size advantage over YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), their primary fish prey, which facilitated a shift to piscivory as soon as these bluegill became available as food. In contrast, slow growth during the invertebrate feeding stage reduced the size advantage of bass over bluegill and delayed or even prevented the shift to piscivory in the ist yr. Niche shifts in bass were also sensitive to environmental conditions ear ly in the growing season. In 1992, low temperatures caused a reduction in growth rates that prevented the establishment of a size advantage over bluegill in all but one lake. Bass grew much faster after switching to piscivory; thus the shift from invertebrates to fish strongly influenced sizes attained by YOY bass by autumn. Because survivorship of YOY bass is strongly size dependent (particularly through the first winter), the timing of the shift to piscivory may be important in determining survival and recruitment rates. Therefore, processes that operate on bass in the invertebrate feeding stage can influence the shift to piscivory, and this can potentially have important effects on the dynamics of the population as a whole.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, WK KELLOGG BIOL STN, HICKORY CORNERS, MI 49060 USA; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, HICKORY CORNERS, MI 49060 USA",NA,265,86,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,179,"190",NA,"10.2307/2265667",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Root nicotine production is activated by an endogenously produced signal, jasmonic acid (JA), which is synthesized in response to leaf damage and either directly through transport or indirectly via another signal, increases JA pools in the roots. The addition of JA or its methyl ester (MJ) to the roots of hydroponically grown plants stimulates nicotine production in the same way that leaf damage does. In this paper we use MJ to stimulate the induced defense without damaging plants in order to examine the hypothesis that these plants have an immunological ''memory'' of prior inductions. Such a ''memory'' can be measured as a change in either the speed or the amount of induced nicotine production or accumulation that results from prior inductions. ''Memory'' is an important component of the induced defenses of animals and is predicted to evolve in systems where an initial attack is a reliable predictor of future attacks. We induced 200 plants 1, 2, or 3 times during an 18-d period of rosette growth, allowed 6 d between inductions for the relaxation of the response between inductions and quantified changes in biomass, whole-plant nicotine pools and de novo rates of nicotine production from N-15-labeled nitrate acquired at the time of induction. Induced changes in nicotine pools and the rates of nicotine production varied across the three induction periods: the highest rates and induced pools occurred during the second induction period, but the highest concentrations were found during the first induction period. The rates of de novo nicotine production from N-15-labeled nitrate were dramatically increased by MJ stimulations during all three induction periods. We found no evidence for alterations in the rates of nicotine production in plants not currently exposed to MJ; 6 d after an induction, plants had relaxed their rates of nicotine production to levels that were not significantly different from those found in plants without a prior induction history. Moreover, the maximum pools of N-15-labeled nicotine were equivalent among all induced plants regardless of prior induction history. In summary, one or two prior inductions did not markedly affect nicotine production from recently acquired nitrate as measured in either induced or uninduced plants. However, the ecologically more relevant measure of the speed of induction is the change in whole-plant nicotine pools, and plants with one and two prior inductions increased their whole-plant nicotine pool significantly faster during the third induction period than did plants not previously induced. Plants with two prior inductions attained significant increases in their nicotine pools 2 d earlier than did plants with one or no prior inductions. Moreover, the effect was additive: plants with two prior inductions were faster than plants with one. The effects of prior inductions on the speed of the induced response did not translate into increases in the magnitude of the response at the end of the 18-d experiment. The lack of change in the magnitude of the induced response may reflect the methods used in our experiment more than the plant's capabilities. The whole-plant induced response is limited by the amount of signal transported to the roots, and since we used the same amount of MJ in all stimulations, our experiment would not detect ''memory'' in the production of the signal in the damaged leaf or its transport to the roots. These results demonstrate that plants, like animals, alter their induced defense in response to their prior experiences.",NA,"Baldwin, IT (corresponding author), SUNY BUFFALO,DEPT BIOL SCI,BUFFALO,NY 14260, USA.",85,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,236,"246",NA,"10.2307/2265673",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This question has been the source of considerable discussion during the last two decades, yet few experiments have tested whether competition intensity changes with productivity in nature. Even fewer studies have separated competition into its above- and belowground components in the field. We used a field experiment to measure total competition intensity and its above- and belowground components in two wetlands that represent extremes in habitat productivity: an infertile sandy shoreline and a fertile bay. Transplants of Lythrum salicaria and Carer crinita were grown with no neighbors, with roots of neighbors only, and with roots and shoots of neighbors; their growth rates were used to measure competition intensity (CI). The experiment was carried out to answer the following main questions: (1) Is there a difference in total, above- and ground competition intensity in two wetlands that differ in standing crop? and (2) Is there an effect of standing crop on total, above- and belowground competition intensity when the data from the two wetlands are combined? Results based on the average of both species show that total and aboveground competition intensity were greater in the high standing crop wetland, but belowground competition did not differ between wetlands (CITOTAL: P < 0.00001, CIABOVE: P = 0.0013, CIBELOW:P = 0.58).

Discrete generations were enforced by harvesting mature plants after seed dispersal, but germination, recruitment, competition, and dispersal occurred naturally. The numerical dynamics of the experimental populations cycled from high to low density with a period of four to five generations, as indicated by negative autocorrelations in population size at lags of two and three generations. Demographic data collected during the experiment indicate that population density affected plant growth and seed set. Independent estimates of low-density recruitment were also high enough to predict complex population dynamics from simple models of direct density-dependent population regulation. However, simple population models fit to the time series data predicted stable dynamics. Similar models including time-lagged density dependence qualitatively reproduced the dynamics of the experimental populations. Delayed feedback through maternal effects or interacting herbivores or pathogens may be possible causes of the observed dynamics. This suggests that although plant population dynamics may be stabilized by direct density dependence, delayed density dependence could destabilize dynamics.","UNIV VIRGINIA,DEPT BIOL,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA 22903","Crone, EE (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT BOT,BOX 90339,DURHAM,NC 27708, USA.",37,17,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,289,"299",NA,"10.2307/2265678",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Consequently, perennial organisms that reproduce continuously are generally restricted to tropical regions with relatively aseasonal climates. The temperate marine alga Macrocystis pyrifera is a rare exception in this regard, as most individuals reproduce throughout the year in a seasonally variable habitat. Here we measure reproductive responses of the giant kelp Mncrocystis during a period in which resources and environmental conditions fluctuated greatly and contrast these responses with those of the palm kelp, Pterygophora californica, a sympatric species that exhibits strictly seasonal reproduction. The quantity and quality of spore production tracked resource availability within and among years for Macrocystis, but not for Pterygophora. Reproductive allocation and spore standing stock in Macrocystis were negatively correlated with seawater temperature and positively correlated with the nitrogen content of adult plants. Macrocystis generally displayed two seasonally distinct peaks in spore production per year (winter and spring). The only disruption of this pattern coincided with a warmwater El Nino event. Although seawater temperature and the nitrogen content of adults were inversely related in Pterygophora, neither variable was significantly correlated with the quantity or quality of spore production in this species. Unlike Mncrocystis, Pterygophora exhibited a well-defined reproductive season in which plants displayed a single broad peak in spore production that varied little in timing and magnitude among years, even during El Nino conditions. Spore C/N ratios remained relatively constant over time in both species, despite large seasonal fluctuations in C/N ratios of vegetative tissue of adults plants. Nonetheless, spore C/N ratios were positively correlated with seawater temperature in Macrocystis but not in Pterygophora. Spore viability (swimming and germination) varied considerably, and often unpredictably, over time for both species. Our results support the general idea that environmental conditions and resources exert a much greater influence on the quantity and quality of reproduction in species that reproduce continuously than on the majority of species that are strictly seasonal in onset of reproduction The differential responses of Macrocystis and Pterygophora may reflect their different morphologies and life-spans. Macrocystis is relatively short lived and may ''hedge its bets'' by reproducing continuously rather than risk delaying reproduction. Conversely, since Pterygophora lives much longer, plants can afford to release spores only during times when the chances for reproductive success are predictably greatest because these plants are likely to reproduce again in subsequent years.",NA,"Reed, DC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",66,29,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1996,77,"1",NA,NA,NA,300,"316",NA,"10.2307/2265679",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Laboratory food quality experiments were conducted to determine the growth response of each species when grown on several resource types: burned organic matter, periphyton, unburned coarse particulate material (CPM), and unburned fine particulate material (FPM). The central hypothesis of this research was that benthic macroinvertebrates cannot use burned organic matter as a resource. A secondary hypothesis was that some benthic macroinvertebrates are facultative in trophic function, with the ability to use both allochthonous and autochthonous resources for growth. Of the 11 taxa studied, only one (Paraleptophlebia heteronea) could grow on burned organic matter as a resource, indicating that post-fire food webs probably do not exhibit major shifts in resource utilization to burned material. Two species were generalist detritivores (P. heteronea, Ameletus cooki) able to use both natural FPM and CPM resources. Two species were specialist detritivores (Oligophlebodes sigma, Ephemerella infrequens) growing only on unburned CPM resources, and two (Cinygmula mimus, Epeorus albertae) were specialist herbivores utilizing only periphyton. Five species were generalist herbivore-detritivores (Baetis bicaudatus, Drunella doddsi, D. coloradensis, D. spinifera, Zapada columbiana), exhibiting growth on both detritus and periphyton resources.

Habitat fragmentation provides a familiar example of a critical threshold. As the landscape becomes dissected into smaller parcels of habitat, landscape connectivity-the functional linkage among habitat patches-may suddenly become disrupted, which may have important consequences for the distribution and persistence of populations. Landscape connectivity depends not only on the abundance and spatial patterning of habitat, but also on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of species. Habitat specialists with limited dispersal capabilities presumably have a much lower threshold to habitat fragmentation than highly vagile species, which may perceive the landscape as functionally connected across a greater range of fragmentation severity. To determine where threshold effects in species' responses to landscape structure are likely to occur, we developed a simulation model modified from percolation theory. Our simulations predicted the distributional patterns of populations in different landscape mosaics? which we tested empirically using two grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that occur in the shortgrass prairie of north-central Colorado. Increasing degree of habitat specialization and dispersal range of a species enhanced the level of aggregation-the degree of clumping exhibited by the population-in our simulations. The landscape threshold at which populations became aggregated was affected by dispersal range for habitat generalists, but not for habitat specialists. Habitat specialists exhibited aggregated populations when preferred habitat occupied <40% of the landscape. Habitat generalists with good dispersal abilities occurred as aggregated populations when <35% of the landscape contained suitable habitat; habitat generalists with limited dispersal only formed patchy distributions when the preferred habitat was a minor (20%) proportion of the habitat. In field tests, a large species of grasshopper (Xanthippus corallipes Haldeman) exhibited reduced rates of travel in two microhabitats that together comprised 35% of a grassland mosaic; a smaller species (Psoloessa delicatula Scudder) had the highest residence time in a rare microhabitat that occurred in only 8% of the landscape. On the basis of our simulation results, we predicted that the large species would be patchily distributed because the abundance of its associated habitat is at the critical threshold. The small species should be unable to aggregate, given the rarity of habitat for which it has an affinity, and thus should be randomly distributed across the landscape. The distribution of these two species in this grassland mosaic matched the predictions from our simulations. By providing quantitative predictions of threshold effects, this modelling approach may prove useful in the formulation of conservation strategies and assessment of land-use changes on species' distributional patterns and persistence.","OAK RIDGE NATL LAB, DIV ENVIRONM SCI, OAK RIDGE, TN 37831 USA; COLORADO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA",NA,536,217,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","DEC",1995,76,"8",NA,NA,NA,2446,"2459",NA,"10.2307/2265819",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Increased evenness of cache distribution resulted from harvesting and repositioning of extant caches as well as selective placement of new caches.

The importance of ecological correlates with dioecy has proven difficult to assess, however, because of lack of data on the origins of dioecy in the Hawaiian Islands. Clearly, these correlations are of greater interest in taxa where dioecy evolved in the Hawaiian Islands (autochthonous evolution of dioecy) than in taxa that are the result of dioecious colonists with subsequent speciation in the Hawaiian Islands. Because the Hawaiian flora is small and extremely isolated, colonists can be identified and their breeding systems hypothesized, thus allowing inferences on the origins of dioecy. Using current taxonomic information, the incidence of dioecy in native Hawaiian angiosperm species is 14.7%, lower than previous estimates, but still the highest of any known flora worldwide. Ten percent of the colonists were sexually dimorphic (dioecious, gynodioecious, polygamodioecious, and subdioecious), and over half (55.2%) of current dimorphic species are in lineages arising from dimorphic colonists, showing that dimorphism is high in part because colonists were dimorphic. Autochthonous evolution of dimorphism occurred in at least 12 lineages (e.g., hermaphroditic colonists of Bidens (Asteraceae), the Hawaiian Alsinoideae (Caryophyllaceae), and Hedyotis (Rubiaceae) led to species-rich lineages that include many dimorphic species). One-third (31.8%) of current dimorphic species are in lineages arising from monomorphic colonists. Dioecy in the Hawaiian Islands is a result of both dimorphic colonists as well as evolution of dioecy in Hawaiian lineages from hermaphroditic colonists. The high incidence of dimorphism is not because dimorphic colonists evolved more species per colonist than monomorphic colonists. Detailed studies of individual lineages are critical to elucidate causal factors in the evolution of dioecy.","USA,CORPS ENGINEERS,FT SHAFTER,HI 96858; SMITHSONIAN INST,NATL MUSEUM NAT HIST,DEPT BOT,WASHINGTON,DC 20560","SAKAI, AK (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717, USA.",138,44,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","DEC",1995,76,"8",NA,NA,NA,2517,"2529",NA,"10.2307/2265825",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Based on a recent taxonomic treatment of the Hawaiian angiosperm flora, we analyzed biogeographic patterns of dioecy as well as the association of dioecy with ecological traits potentially important in the evolution of dioecy for native current species and genera. We also analyzed patterns for presumed colonists of the flora to control better for phylogenetic patterns in these traits. Dioecy is associated with woodiness, especially trees; however, this pattern does not hold for gynodioecy. Within woody species, dimorphism (dioecy, gynodioecy, subdioecy, polygamodioecy) is associated with mesic habitats and occurs more frequently in species with lowland and lowland-montane distributions. In contrast, in the endemic Hawaiian Alsinoideae (Schiedea and Alsinidendron) and in Bidens (two groups with autochthonous evolution of dimorphism), dimorphism is associated with more xeric habitats, and for the former group, with wind pollination. For the entire angiosperm flora, dimorphic species are associated with flowers that are small and green. Woody dioecious species and genera are disproportionately associated with wind pollination; hermaphroditic species are disproportionately bird pollinated primarily because of one species-rich lineage in the Campanulaceae. There was no association of dimorphism and pollinator type for colonists. Because of a few species-rich lineages, dimorphism is associated with dry fruits at the specific level, but at the generic level and for colonists, dimorphism is associated with fleshy fruits. Dioecious and gynodioecious species are found more often on older islands, a result of speciation of dimorphic colonists as well as autochthonous evolution of dimorphism. Single-island endemism is not associated with dioecy in the flora as a whole or with dimorphism within lineages evolving dimorphism autochthonously; thus Baker's law is not supported within the Hawaiian Islands. Because the Hawaiian angiosperm flora originated from a minimum of only 291 colonists, many of the associations of dimorphism with ecological traits occur because of the influence of only a few species-rich lineages. Better knowledge of phylogenetic patterns and further ecological studies, particularly within those groups evolving dioecy autochthonously, are needed to determine causality.","USA, CORPS ENGINEERS, FT SHAFTER, HI 96858 USA; SMITHSONIAN INST, NATL MUSEUM NAT HIST, DEPT BOT, WASHINGTON, DC 20560 USA","SAKAI, AK (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA.",111,38,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","DEC",1995,76,"8",NA,NA,NA,2530,"2543",NA,"10.2307/2265826",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Data published for woody species from Manu, Peru and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama were analyzed by dispersal mode and gap size preference for comparison. Larger seeds at the three sites were significantly associated with canopy or emergent trees or lianas that are dispersed by mammals or gravity and recruit best in small gaps. Variation in seed size, after accounting for the effects of plant height and life-form, could be explained by dispersal mode (Mabura Hill: 22%, Manu: 14%, BCI: 26%) and gap size preference (Mabura Hill: 9%, Manu: 7%, BCI: 11%). Soil type preference, analyzed only for Mabura Hill, was not associated with seed size. Mean seed size at Mabura Hill was significantly larger than at Manu or BCI. Short-term successional processes may explain the variation of seed size within sites; dispersal mode is particularly important in defining seed size selection during a the successional process. However, short-term successional processes cannot explain the variation of seed size among sites. It is suggested that this variation may be attributed to differences in the effects of larger-scale variations in soils and disturbance on seed size among the three sites.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT BIOL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND",NA,154,28,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1995,76,"8",NA,NA,NA,2544,"2561",NA,"10.2307/2265827",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We made local and widespread measurements of tree condition in three periods: prehurricane 1974-1984 (preh.); hurricane 1984-1989 (h.); and post-hurricane 1989-1992 (post-h.). In the h. period, 7.22% of stems and 4.72% of the total basal area died; crown loss was the most frequent cause of mortality. Among individual tree species, the hurricane caused a large range in mortality (0-26%) and non-fatal damage. Post-h. mortality was greater than mortality in the h. period, and varied among species. Post-h. stem growth rates (all species combined) were more than double the prehurricane rates, but species showed a considerable range from no significant increase to eight times greater. We classified 20 common tree species using damage scores (normalized h. mortality, plus normalized change in mortality from preh. to post-h., plus normalized complete crown loss in h.) and response scores (normalized change, preh. to post-h., in recruitment to the greater than or equal to 3 cm dbh size class, plus normalized change in growth rate from preh. to post-h., plus normalized frequency of sprouts). Species were assigned to one of four groups: resistant (11 species), with low damage and low response; susceptible (5 species), with high damage and low response; resilient(1 species), with high damage and high response; and usurpers (3 species), with low damage and high responsiveness. The grouping of species was broadly related to their regeneration requirements. Most species with seedlings usually found under closed canopy were resistant; three of the four species with seedlings usually found on landslides were also resistant. Species with seedlings most frequently found in gaps included resilient, susceptible, and usurper species, but were not usually resistant. It is likely that the three species classified as usurpers will increase their relative abundance in the forest in the next decades and that Cyathea pubescens, which was very susceptible, will decrease in relative abundance of adults. Most of the other species are likely to have small changes in their relative abundances. Thus, at present, hurricanes have few long-term effects on the forests, although a change in the disturbance regime may alter this.","UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT PLANT SCI,CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA,ENGLAND; UNIV COLL N WALES,SCH AGR & FOREST SCI,BANGOR LL57 2UW,GWYNEDD,WALES",NA,128,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","DEC",1995,76,"8",NA,NA,NA,2562,"2580",NA,"10.2307/2265828",19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Within 568 ha of nonswamp old-growth lowland forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we sampled at 516 intersections of a reserve-wide grid to systematically assess the species' distributions across the major edaphic gradients. We found mosaics of community structure related to marked within-forest variability in both soil and topography. Total stem density of this guild varied with both edaphic factors. Steep sites had twice as many large palms (>10 m tall) per hectare than those on gentler topography or at lower slope positions. The combined density of subcanopy and canopy palms also varied significantly among soil types in the smallest size class (1-5 m tall), but not for larger individuals. Local (point) species richness of the subcanopy and canopy palms varied among soil types. Of the seven species, two (Astrocaryum alatum and A. confertum) were rare. All others showed significant edaphic variation in their distribution and/or estimated density. Two closely related species had strong and opposite edaphic associations. Euterpe macrospadix was biased toward steep topography and less fertile sites. Prestoea decurrens was nearly ommipresent on soil types with gentle topography while absent from half the points on soils with steep slopes. Two other closely related species, Iriartea deltoidea and Socratea exorrhiza, while virtually omnipresent across soil types and topographic positions, showed marked reciprocal variation in density between related soils. Iriartea's spatial distribution further indicates local removal of this species from one sector of the old growth by human harvesting (with subsequent apparent ''release'' of Socratea in this site). The most abundant species, Welfia georgii, while present at all sample points, showed significant among-soil variation in density. This substructuring of the arborescent palm guild results from the interplay of edaphic variation and past human activity.

In Experiment I, seeds of F. stupenda were planted in potential establishment sites averaging 31 m above the ground in each of 45 dipterocarp trees. Twenty seeds each were planted in a total of 336 sites. Germination, survivorship, and growth were monitored over 1 yr, and examined in relation to microsite and host tree characteristics. The presence of substrate with good moisture retention (soil, rotting wood, or moss) was the most important factor for germination. Such substrates were most frequently associated with knothole sites in the canopy, which had the highest level of establishment success. Seedling survival to 12 mo was low (1.3% of planted seeds), especially considering that the best available sites in each tree were selected. Only 0.04% of seedlings showed vigorous growth after 12 mo. A seed-harvesting ant in the genus Pheidole significantly reduced germination success, and herbivory and desiccation killed many seedlings at later stages. In Experiment 2, seedling growth in natural canopy sites was compared with growth of seedlings in artificial planter boxes raised into the canopy in order to assess the relative quality of canopy sites. Planters were superior to natural sites for seedling survivorship and supported much more rapid seedling growth with a positive response to light level. Higher growth rates in planters compared with natural sites showed that water stress appeared to be the critical factor limiting seedling growth in the canopy, even in this very wet climate. Sites in the canopy with the optimal combination of conditions for fig seedling establishment appear to be very scarce.

Our analyses focused on, but were not limited to, censuses of birds recorded in the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Birds and other organisms exhibited a common pattern: each species was represented by only a few individuals in most of the sample sites where it occurred, but was orders of magnitude more abundant in a few ''hot spots.'' The highly clumped frequency distributions of intraspecific abundance among sample sites resemble distributions, such as the negative binomial, canonical lognormal, and broken stick, that have been used to characterize the distribution of abundances among species within local ecological communities. We hypothesize that the spatial variation in abundance largely reflects the extent to which local sites satisfy the niche requirements of a species. Several results are consistent with this hypothesis. First, a computer simulation model in which abundance is determined by the multiplicative combination of several independent environmental variables produces ranked distributions of abundances similar to those observed empirically. Second, geographic patterns of abundance of bird species have been relatively stable over several decades, indicating that different abundances are associated with particular places on the landscape. Third, the abundance of bird species varies in a systematic way over the geographic range, exhibiting positive spatial autocorrelation at small distances and a tendency to increase from the edges toward the center of the range. The magnitude and pattern of spatial variation in local population density has important implications for basic ecology and biogeography, especially for the dynamics and regulation of abundance in both space and time, the limits and internal structure of the geographic range, and the interspecific variation in abundance observed within local communities.

Models of adaptive foraging behavior in the face of predation risk predict that at higher resource levels, foraging activity should be reduced. Thus, at higher resource levels predation mortality should also be reduced. We manipulated the resources available to Rana catesbeiana tadpoles and then measured the activity of tadpoles in the presence of caged dragonfly larvae and the mortality rate of the tadpoles when the dragonflies were free to forage. At low food levels the tadpoles moved more often and more quickly. Similarly, at low food levels the tadpoles suffered higher predation mortality. The dependence of predation mortality on resources available to prey underlines the futility of characterizing population regulation as being due to predation or resources. Adaptive variation in behavior responds to both pressures simultaneously. These results also suggest the possibility that adaptive variation in behavior may lead to density-dependent population regulation. Density-dependent depletion of resources by prey should lead to increased activity levels, which will result in higher per capita predation rates. The generality of the trade-off between growth rate and mortality rate argues that this mechanism may be widespread. If adaptive variation in behavior is as widespread as it appears, incorporating this variation into population dynamic modelling may improve our ability to predict the outcome of interactions within ecological communities.","UNIV TORONTO,ERINDALE COLL,DEPT ZOOL,MISSISSAUGA,ON L5L 1C6,CANADA; UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",NA,292,95,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","OCT",1995,76,"7",NA,NA,NA,2230,"2234",NA,"10.2307/1941696",5,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This is interpreted by some avian ecologists to reflect an inherent digestive constraint on diet selection, but it could also result from dietary acclimation. We predicted that Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata) acclimated to fruit-, insect-, and seed-based diets would exhibit retention times that increase in that rank order, because this is the rank order of retention time across species that eat these types of food. We also predicted a trade-off between rate of processing (the inverse of retention time) and extraction efficiency. This is based on the assumption that digestive enzymes or absorptive capacity occur in the gastrointestinal tract at levels that are not in great excess, and so less contact time between enzymes and digesta reduces the extraction efficiency. To test these predictions, we measured retention time (using aqueous and lipid-phase inert markers) and extraction efficiency of glucose, sucrose, leucine, starch, and the lipid glycerol trioleate (using radio-labeled nutrients and inert markers). Our results were in accordance with predictions. Mouth-to-anus total mean retention time (TMRT) of Yellow-rumped Warblers acclimated to fruit-, insect-, and seed-based diets were, respectively, 46 +/- 9, 62 +/- 6, and 114 +/- 9 min for polyethylene glycol (PEG, an aqueous marker): results were similar for the lipid phase marker in most cases. But Yellow-rumped Warblers that were switched suddenly to an alternate diet did not readjust TMRT when tested 2 h later or did so incompletely. We found no diet-related morphological changes in the digestive tract, and thus attribute these results to changes in gut motility. Extraction efficiency was uniformly high across all diets for glucose (88 +/- 1%), but varied among diet groups according to our prediction for leucine (range 82 - 94%), sucrose (58 - 85%), starch (9 - 48%), and lipid (18 - 82%). We review how features of the Yellow-rumped Warbler's digestive system permit relatively high energy uptake across a wide variety of food types. The most notable constraining feature was a low starch hydrolysis rate, probably restricting them from relying on starchy foods. Thus, digestive strategy (i.e., a combination of retention time of food in the gut and digestive efficiency) somewhat determines diet, but in more respects diet determines strategy.","UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT WILDLIFE ECOL,MADISON,WI 53706",NA,164,39,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","OCT",1995,76,"7",NA,NA,NA,2247,"2257",NA,"10.2307/1941699",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This resulted in small crabs using shells that were damaged, much smaller than the sizes they preferred, and of less common species or species that did not inhabit the sand flat. Habitat use by males was more diverse than by females. The males used shells of U. moniliferum and other snails inhabiting the sand flat and shells of preferred size more frequently than did females, and also tended to use shells that were larger and more variable in size, Shells that were broken or epibiota covered were less preferred by both sexes, although epibiota-covered shells were used more frequently by males. Broken shells were used at similar frequency by both sexes. Crabs supplied with shells of a similar size distribution to that available in the field were cultured for 1 yr. Males tended to grow faster than females, exhausting the limited supply of medium-sized shells. The smaller crabs restrained their growth until such shells became available, explaining the absence of a peak of small crabs in the field population. Although the sex ratio of the field population was female biased, that of the laboratory population was 1:1, indicating that males had a higher mortality rate in the field. These results suggest that males are better intraspecific competitors than females in the acquisition of vacant shells. This quality enables males to grow larger, which is advantageous in the acquisition of females. However, shell scarcity produced greater stress in males resulting in their higher mortality rate.","KYUSHU UNIV, AMAKUSA MARINE BIOL LAB, REIHOKU, KUMAMOTO 86325, JAPAN",NA,54,16,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1995,76,"7",NA,NA,NA,2295,"2313",NA,"10.2307/1941703",19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Juveniles of D. pulex produce morphological changes (''neckteeth'') and undergo life history shifts as defenses against predatory Chaoborus (phantom midge) larvae. These traits are induced by a chemical cue (kairomone) released by the predator. I performed life history experiments with and without Chaoborus kairomones at different food levels to quantify the induced changes and their potential physiological costs. The Daphnia clone used in this study also increased its body depth in response to the predator substance. Life history shifted toward a larger body size (both length and depth) and higher fecundity, which was balanced by an increased time to reach maturity and by increased adult instar durations, Reproductive effort was higher in the typical morph in the first adult instar, indicating resource allocation shifts towards growth in the protected morph. However, even in the absence of predation the chemically induced protected morph tended to show an increased intrinsic rate of population growth (r). The longer time to reach maturity was not a direct physiological cost of neckteeth production, but a trade-off for larger body size. The life history shifts are independent of neckteeth formation. Developmental mechanisms leading to life history changes occurred after neckteeth were induced and could thus be uncoupled from neckteeth formation and its direct costs. In this study no direct costs were found. Carbon incorporation rates for the two morphs, at high and low food, were not different. As a maternal effect, the larger females of the induced morph produced larger neonates which, in turn, matured at a larger size. Morphological changes, life history shifts, and maternal effects acted in concert to form defenses against Chaoborus. This study shows that the often assumed high physiological costs resulting from the formation or maintenance of the defenses are not necessary to explain the evolution of inducible defenses. As morphological changes increase the visibility of Daphnia pulex, a fitness disadvantage can be caused by a changing predator regime (e.g., fish). The results of this study suggest that environments with changing predator selectivities favor the evolution of inducible defenses.",NA,"TOLLRIAN, R (corresponding author), MAX PLANCK INST LIMNOL, POSTFACH 165, D-24302 PLON, GERMANY.",302,180,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1995,76,"6",NA,NA,NA,1691,"1705",NA,"10.2307/1940703",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Having three direct consumer-resource links, three indirect numerical links, and a potential for indirect effects mediated by size structure and/or behavioral flexibility, a three-species omnivory system may exhibit complex population dynamics. In 2 x 3 m field enclosures in the littoral zone of a lake, I manipulated the dominating native benthivorous fish (greater than or equal to 2yr-old perch, Perca fluviatilis, omnivorous top consumer) and the dominating native benthic invertebrate predators (Sialis lutaria, Megaloptera, and odonates, intermediate consumers) in three gradients: increasing densities of perch in the near absence of Sialis and odonates, and increasing densities of Sialis and odonates in either the presence or absence of perch. The densities of their common prey (mainly chironomids) were left unmanipulated. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and size structure, as well as gut contents of perch and Sialis were sampled monthly over a 3-mo summer period. In the absence of perch, the experimental gradient of Sialis densities remained unchanged over time. In the presence of perch, Sialis decreased by about half at high initial densities, but remained unchanged at low initial densities. Perch also had a negative effect on odonates. In the near absence of Sialis and odonates, perch had a strong, negative effect on chironomids. Compared to enclosures without perch, chironomid abundance was strongly reduced at the lowest perch density, but leveled off with further increases in perch density. Sialis and odonates did not affect chironomid abundance when perch were absent. In contrast, chironomid abundance was positively affected by Sialis and odonates when perch were present. The overall effect of perch on chironomid abundance in the presence of Sialis and odonates was negative. The combined predatory and competitive effects of perch on Sialis and odonates raise the issue how Sialis and odonates coexist with perch. The lack of effect of perch on Sialis and chironomids at low densities of these prey suggests that prey refuges contribute significantly to their persistence in natural systems. The indirect positive effect of Sialis and odonates on chironomids indicates density dependence in per capita interaction coefficients and is most likely to be explained by a behavioral response of perch or chironomids to Sialis and odonates. I suggest that the theoretical and empirical investigation of model systems (such as three-component omnivory systems), which are sufficiently simple to be analytically and experimentally tractable, but still display a richness of common indirect effects, will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of more complex food webs. Their study will benefit from experimental manipulations of more than one population at more than two densities.","UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN",NA,94,46,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1995,76,"6",NA,NA,NA,1727,"1740",NA,"10.2307/1940706",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Specifically, we predicted that monogamy would be associated with uniform resources, regardless of population density, giving way to polygyny with increasing resource patchiness at intermediate densities, and to multiple males and females at high population densities. In addition, we predicted inbreeding at low densities and outbreeding at high densities on the basis of naturally low levels of genetic heterogeneity in this species.

Aggregate response of flowering guilds was stronger. By the last (1993) census, the phenological guild flowering before mid-July (summed cover values for nine species) accounted for 4% cover in unburned plots and <2% cover in plots burned in early spring, but 32% cover in plots burned in midsummer.

Surfgrass (Phyllospadix torreyi) is a clonal marine angiosperm that lives on turbulent rocky shores. Surfgrass exhibits a strongly female-biased sex ratio in flowering shoots throughout its distribution along the Pacific coast of North America. The ecological causes for this biased sex ratio were examined over 3 yr in a surfgrass population off Catalina Island in southern California, USA. Abundances, biomass, and C:N content of male and female flowering ramets were measured, and the reproductive phenology, reproductive losses to abortions, herbivore damage to fruits and seeds, and clonal survival and growth were quantified. Each year, a quarter of the vegetative ramets reproduced sexually and seed production in the population was prolific. The population sex ratio was female biased across the entire depth distribution of surfgrass, but males were more abundant deeper in the bed. Despite male rarity, pollen was abundant in the population, and virtually all ovules were fertilized, with few losses to abortions or herbivory before seed release. Potential female fitness (seeds produced) was highest at shallow depths where light availability was greatest and abortions were reduced. The spatial segregation of the sexes was not due to environmental sex lability but to greater ramification of female vs. male clones in shallow depths. Female flowering shoots had significantly higher biomass than males across water depth, despite no obvious cost in terms of vegetative growth, or advantage in terms of plant size. If current theory on sex allocation that the sex ratio should be biased toward the gender with the lower reproductive cost is true for surfgrass, then surfgrass provides an example of how a subtle resource allocation difference can result in a dramatic population bias. An alternative explanation for the female bias in surfgrass populations is greater male mortality due to significantly weaker attachment to the substratum.

I argue that these correspond to significant differences between Grinnell's and Elton's concepts distinct from the previously discussed ''habitat'' vs. ''functional'' dichotomy. I illustrate the distinction between the requirement and impact components of the niche using models of resource competition and of keystone predators, and I discuss ''Gause's axiom'' and conventional ''niche theory'' in the context of these two distinct niche components. I suggest that the niche concept be elucidated by explicit reference to these two distinct components; the ''impact'' niche (corresponding to Elton's concept) describing instantaneous per-capita effects of species on the environment, and the ''requirement'' niche describing the response of species to the environment (corresponding to Hutchinson's definition).

Climate, dominant vegetation, slope, and parent material of all of the sites were similar. As fractions of total P, the various pools of soil phosphorus behaved very much as predicted by Walker and Syers. HCl-extractable P (presumably primary mineral phosphates) comprised 82% of total P at the 300-yr-old site, and then decreased to 1% at the 20,000-yr-old site. Organic phosphorus increased from the youngest site to a maximum at the 150 000 yr site, and then declined to the 4.1 X 10(6) yr site. Occluded (residual) P increased steadily with soil age. In contrast to the Walker and Syers model, we found the highest total P at the 150 000-yr-old site, rather than at the onset of soil development, and we found that the non-occluded, inorganic P fraction persisted through to the oldest chronosequence site. Total soil N and C increased substantially from early to middle soil development in parallel with organic P, and then declined through to the oldest site. Readily available soil P, NH4+, and NO3- were measured using anion and cation exchange resin bags. P availability increased and decreased unimodally across the chronosequence. NH4+ and NO3- pools increased through early soil development, but did not systematically decline late in soil development. In situ decomposition rates of Metrosideros polymorpha litter were highest at two intermediate-aged sites with high soil fertility (20 000 yr and 150 000 yr), and lowest at the less-fertile beginning (300 yr) and endpoint (4.1 X 10(6) yr) of the chronosequence. M. polymorpha leaves collected from these same four sites, and decomposed in a common site, suggested that leaves from intermediate-aged sites were inherently more decomposable than those from the youngest and oldest sites. Both litter tissue quality and the soil environment appeared to influence rates of decomposition directly. The highest mean soil N2O emissions (809 mu g . m(-2). d(-1)) were measured at the 20 000-yr-old site, which also had the highest soil nitrogen fertility status. Plant communities at all six chronosequence sites were dominated primarily by M. polymorpha, and to a lesser extent by several other genera of trees and shrubs. There were, however, differences in overall vegetation community composition among the sites. Using a detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA), we found that a high proportion of species variance among the sites (eigenvalue = 0.71) can be explained by site age and thus soil developmental stage. Overall, long-term soil development across the chronosequence largely coincides with the conceptual model of Walker and Syers (1976). How P is distributed among different organic and inorganic fractions at a given stage of soil development provides a useful context for evaluating contemporary cycling of P and other nutrients, and for determining how changes in P availability might affect diverse ecosystem processes.","STANFORD UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,STANFORD,CA 94305; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT BOT,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT AGRON & SOIL SCI,HONOLULU,HI 96822",NA,622,298,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JUL",1995,76,"5",NA,NA,NA,1407,"1424",NA,"10.2307/1938144",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To help explain disparity in species-specific responses to growing-season length, we examined the developmental phenology and distribution of each species in relation to natural snow depth variation. Season length varies from approximate to 50 d on early-melting edges of the snowbed to 35 d in the late-melting center, 100 m away. By experimentally altering snowpack, we uncoupled the relationship between spatial location and snowmelt schedule in three consecutive years, imposing the same early dates of snow release in a ''long growing-season'' treatment and the same late dates of snow release in a ''short growing-season'' treatment near the edge and center of the snowbed. Over the course of the experiment, growing-season length had significant effects on absolute and relative cover of the species studied (P < 0.025 and P < 0.005, respectively), and these effects were similar near both the edge and center of the snowbed. Yet, only for the snowbed specialist, Sibbaldia procumbens, were changes in absolute and relative cover under early and late snowmelt schedules predictable from the species' distribution along the historical snow depth gradient. S. procumbens increased in cover under a long growing-season and was more common in historically early-melting portions of the snowbed. Other species (e.g., Ranunculus adoneus, Artemisia scopulorum) were equally common in historically early- and late-melting locations within the snowbed, but showed discordant responses to experimentally imposed changes in snowmelt schedule. That the cover of many species under long- vs, short growing seasons was not predictable from their current distributional affinities in relation to snowmelt pattern likely reflects the disparity between the rates of processes exerting long-term control on species' abundances (colonization, soil development) and more immediate effects of growing-season length on plant growth. Consistent with this view, differences in developmental phenology better predicted species-specific responses to snowmelt schedule than distributional affinities. Species having leaf expansion schedules that are poorly synchronized with snowmelt typically had similar cover under early vs. late schedules of snow release (Geum rossii, Trifolium parryi, and Poa alpina). In contrast, species in which leaf expansion schedules are synchronized with snowmelt responded positively to early snow release (Ranunculus adoneus and Sibbaldia procumbens). We hypothesize that maintaining metabolic ''readiness'' under snowcover provides a mechanism for monopolizing nutrient flushes and competitor-free intervals at snowmelt, and exploiting occasional long intervals for growth in years of little snow accumulation, but incurs a respiratory cost that is manifest as reduced growth and vegetative cover when snowmelt is delayed. Our results suggest that interspecific differences in growth phenology of coexisting species will promote shifts in snowbed plant communities with climate change within generations.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT BOT,DAVIS,CA 95616; UNIV CALIF DAVIS,CTR POPULAT BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","GALEN, C (corresponding author), UNIV MISSOURI,DIV BIOL SCI,COLUMBIA,MO 65211, USA.",126,64,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JUL",1995,76,"5",NA,NA,NA,1546,"1557",NA,"10.2307/1938156",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Greatest tiller production and the highest photosynthetic rates were observed at the mid-altitude site, but plants at the coastal site attained greater basal areas, aboveground biomass, and number of inflorescences.

Few differences in plant responses, however, were attributable to a population's origin or the site-by-population interaction; resident populations and introduced populations responded similarly at each site. Furthermore, few characters exhibited variation among clones, indicating that these populations likely possess little genetic variation. Limited clonal variation was, however, detected for net photosynthesis, the ratio of internal to ambient CO2 concentration (c(i)/c(a)), and specific leaf area, but only on two of five dates over a 1-yr period. Phenotypic plasticity for both individual characters and the integration of physiological and morphological characters have apparently been most important in allowing P. setaceum to become dominant across diverse habitats on Hawaii.","WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,DEPT BOT,PULLMAN,WA 99164",NA,208,73,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JUL",1995,76,"5",NA,NA,NA,1569,"1580",NA,"10.2307/1938158",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Snakes in these populations differed in growth rate and adult body size, and these differences may be related to the influence of thermal environment on energetics. During summer months, operative environmental temperatures at BOQ were hotter than at GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures resulted in approximate to 64% less time available for diurnal surface use (e.g., foraging) at BOQ relative to GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures also constrained the average T-b of BOQ snakes at night to be from 2 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C hotter than GVH snakes during July and August. Despite hotter T-b, estimated resting metabolic expenditures of BOQ snakes during July and August were similar to estimated expenditures of GVH snakes because BOQ snakes had lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Results of this study were consistent with the hypothesis of greater energy limitation at BOQ, and underscored the importance of population-specific data for understanding geographic variation in energy acquisition and allocation.","UNIV PENN,DEPT BIOL,LEIDY LABS,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104",NA,68,22,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JUL",1995,76,"5",NA,NA,NA,1655,"1665",NA,"10.2307/1938166",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This process, over ecological and geological time scales, comprises a major component of Caribbean reef-building systems. Manipulative experiments showed that as the chiton grazes the alga it stimulates new meristematic activity and removes sporlings of the competitively superior frondose and filamentous algae, thereby increasing the survival rate of P. pachydermum on the intertidal reef crest. Furthermore, in the absence of C. into, overgrowths of frondose and filamentous epiphytes provide an attractive food source for parrotfishes (Scaridae), which accelerates bioerosion of the coralline reef-crest structure due to the deep rasping action of feeding activity. Algal removal experiments suggest that the role of P. pachydermum is to provide a predictable food source and refuge substratum, which increases survivorship of the burrowing chiton by minimizing expenditure of energy during foraging and risk to predation. The chiton/coralline alga association is abundant throughout tropical western Atlantic islands and augments reef-building processes on the shallow algal crest portion of Caribbean reefs. Cover of the Choneplax/Porolithon association in the Belize Barrier Reef cost averages 13% (maximum to 70%) with a mean chiton density of 664 individuals/m(2) within the association. On average, the extensive networks of interconnected chiton burrows extend between 6 and 10 cm deep and contain one C. lata for every six openings, with the majority of animals (66%) ranging from 16 to 30 mm in length. Gut contents of the chiton consist predominantly of P. pachydermum (51%), followed by bacterial detritus (30%), Cyanophyta (13%), Bacillariophyta (3%), and fleshy microalgae (3%). The close SEM (scanning electron microscope) match between radular morphology of C. lata and grazing scars on the thallus surface of P. pachydermum shows how the chiton regularly feeds on the coralline alga without causing mortality. Virtually all P. pachydermum in the vicinity of C., lata burrows contain radular track scars of approximate to 10 mu m in depth, whereas the photosynthetic, meristematic, and reproductive tissues of the coralline lie below 20 mu m P. pachydermum under intense chiton grazing is photosynthetically competent with 0.1 mg C fixed . g(-1) organic dry mass . h(-1), which is not significantly different from ungrazed material and within the range of rates for other crustose coralline algae.

A. Rich. (Cucurbitaceae). Two subspecies are parapatric on the Iberian Peninsula: dioicum (dioecious) is found in southern, more arid regions and elaterium (monoecious) is found in northern, wetter regions. Six experimental gardens were set up in three sites that span the climatic gradient of the species' natural range in Spain in order to address two issues: (1) gender specialization in reproductive characters and life history, and (2) ecological specialization of the two subspecies across environments. Overall, the dioecious subspecies outperformed the monoecious subspecies. Monoecious plants, on average, were shorter-lived in all environments. Females of the dioecious subspecies produced similar numbers of female flowers, but more fruits and seeds, than did monoecious plants (cosexuals). The fruits of females contained more, but smaller, seeds than the fruits of cosexuals. Males always produced more male flowers than did cosexuals, disproportionately so with increased plant size (canopy volume); no such disproportionate increase in seed production was found in females. A geographic analysis of gender (proportion of female flowers) in the monoecious plants revealed a striking pattern: dimorphism with increased gender differentiation in drier sites, in contrast to monomorphism with respect to gender in wetter sites. Differences between the subspecies and between habitat types can be related directly to breeding-system differences. The higher overall performance of dioecious plants may be due to enhanced heterozygosity resulting from outcrossing enforced by dioecy. On the other hand, the gender differentiation of the monoecious plants in the drier sites may reflect gender allocation ''decisions'' enforced by limited resource availability.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855",NA,66,14,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JUN",1995,76,"4",NA,NA,NA,1036,"1050",NA,"10.2307/1940914",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In contrast, New England and central Ontario populations of Decodon verticillatus (Lythraceae) show a marked deficiency of the mid-styled (M) morph. This pattern was also evident in an independent sample of 30 populations from eastern Ontario; all nine cases of morph loss involved the M morph, and this morph also occurred at low frequencies, especially in large trimorphic populations. The hypothesis that a fitness disadvantage to the M morph accounts for its low frequency was not supported by data from a series of held and glasshouse experiments. Measures of reproductive success from two populations showed no disadvantage to the M morph, but revealed substantially higher seed set in the mid- (M) and short-styled (S) morphs than in the long-styled (L) morph. A pollen addition experiment showed that low seed set in the L morph can only partly be explained by reduced pollen receipt. Comparison of morph frequencies between adult plants and their open-pollinated progeny in three populations failed to reveal any morph-specific fitness differences. Analysis of growth and flowering of open-pollinated progeny from three populations in a 2-yr glasshouse experiment revealed differences among morphs for some parameters in some populations, but no consistent patterns were evident. The deficiency of the M morph may have resulted from an historical accident during post-glacial colonization of parts of the northern range. Computer calculations examining the return of morph frequencies to equilibrium after major perturbations indicated that populations of long-lived clonal species like D. verticillatus may preserve skewed morph ratios for > 10 000 yr. Moreover, the distribution of fossil seeds indicates that this species has occurred in its post-glacial range in southern Ontario for only approximate to 5000 yr. It is important to distinguish between ecological and evolutionary time scales when testing selective interpretations of microevolutionary patterns involving clonal taxa in glaciated regions.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT BOT, TORONTO, ON M5S 3B2, CANADA",NA,74,8,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1995,76,"4",NA,NA,NA,1051,"1066",NA,"10.2307/1940915",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The purpose was to determine the extent to which the phenological patterns of these species Varied among plant communities acid how interannual climate variability affects phenology and growth. There were significant differences in growth among communities for both species. In B. bistortoides, there were also significant differences among years, due primarily to the influence of a single year (1983) when leaf length increased by approximate to 10% and the average number of B. bistortoides leaves nearly doubled. Key phenological events of both species (initiation of growth, date of maximum leaf length, leaf number, and flower number) were related to snowmelt patterns, resulting in differences among communities. There were also significant differences among years, again primarily related to the single year 1983, the year of a major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event that produced high snowfall amounts at the site. The increased leaf length in a high snow year is counterintuitive to the commonly accepted notion that alpine species may be limited by season length. We hypothesize that changes in phenology related to changes in snowfall or snowmelt will cause detectable changes in growth, but that these will not be predicted simply from phenology alone. Rather, the timing of snowmelt in relation to nutrient availability, soil moisture, and air temperature will be critical in determining how individual species respond.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT BOT & PLANT PATHOL,E LANSING,MI 48824","WALKER, MD (corresponding author), UNIV COLORADO,INST ARCTIC & ALPINE RES,JOINT FACIL REG ECOSYST ANAL,BOULDER,CO 80309, USA.",141,60,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JUN",1995,76,"4",NA,NA,NA,1067,"1083",NA,"10.2307/1940916",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Each population had five males of heterogeneous origin. Our earlier results showed that populations of the R grew twice as fast as the UR. Here we show that recruitment and offspring survival is connected to spacing behavior of mothers. Unrelated females who had their home ranges close to each other produced significantly fewer recruits than the related ones. Their home ranges overlapped significantly less and ranges were smaller if they were situated close to each other. Furthermore, the survival of juveniles declined with dispersal distance from the natal territory in populations of the UR. Trappabilities of juveniles were also lower among the young whose home ranges were close to unrelated females, indicating avoidance of mature females. Our results indicate that competition for space is more intense among unrelated neighbors, decreasing their reproductive success. Infanticide towards unrelated nestlings and/or juveniles is one possible mechanism decreasing survival and causing a lower recruitment of young. On the contrary, sharing of space among related neighbors did not seem to cause notable costs on their reproduction. Mature females allowed related young females to use their territory, but still, the young: did not acquire an area for their own reproduction, probably due to a mother-daughter conflict.

Switching also has the less apparent cost of a forager's reduced ability to assess the probability of prey presence.

The second level contained Chilomonas paramecium alone, Colpidium cf. striatum alone, or both together. Predatory Euplotes patella occupied the third trophic level. These assemblages were cultured in microcosms containing either low- or high-nutrient medium. Manipulating nutrients and predation produced comparable changes in the abundance of bacteria. In the second trophic level, Chilomonas was usually driven extinct by predation, but Colpidium was affected more by nutrients than predation because it had a partial size refuge from predation. Both species survived more poorly with predatory Euplotes if the other was present, because the predator was more abundant and persistent when both prey were available. The predator was less persistent in high-nutrient microcosms, because additional nutrients boosted the proportion of Colpidium populations within the size refuge.

A graphical model is developed to examine the possibility that growth may ameliorate the effects of predation and physical disturbance on spatial dominance. In the model, growth, mortality, and recruitment are depicted as Vectors on a set of isoclines for log percent cover. The 100% isocline is analogous to the self-thinning line. Self-thinning data for the mussel Mytilus edulis are used to establish the log-percent isoclines. A review of published growth and mortality data suggests mussels can use growth to offset the effects of mortality. Small mussels can easily double in length in 1 yr, and this is sufficient to withstand 60% mortality per year without a loss in percent cover. Since both growth and mortality tend to be size specific, the point at which growth can no longer offset mortality depends on the environmental conditions that affect rates of growth and mortality.

Because virtually all consumers can ingest small quantities of noxious compounds with minimal detrimental effects, it is uncertain that toxic chemicals in larvae could be consumed in quantities sufficient to select for predator recognition and avoidance. Despite this, chemically defended larvae do occur. We show that, at low doses, secondary metabolites (the didemnins) from adults and larvae of the Caribbean tunicate Trididemnum solidum induced vomiting in fish, resulting in rapid learned aversion to the didemnin-defended food. The particle-feeding anemone Aiptasin pallida did not learn to avoid the chemically defended food. When anemones ingested the chemical equivalent of 15 larvae/d, representing <2% of the mass of their total daily diet, the didemnins in the ''larvae'' significantly reduced: (1) growth of adults by 82%, (2) combined growth of adults and daughter clones by 76%, (3) production of daughter clones by 44%, and (4) average mass of individual daughter clones by 41%. At higher water temperatures, anemones cloned more rapidly, but the negative effects of consuming didemnins also occurred more rapidly. Significant differences in the number of daughter clones produced between treatment and control anemones occurred after only 4 d at seawater temperatures of 27 degrees-29 degrees C vs. 32 d at seawater temperatures of 18 degrees-21 degrees C.

Rothermel's intensity model was divided into a fuel component variable and weather component variable, which were then used to examine the relative roles of fuel and weather on surface fire intensity (kilowatts per metre). Similar variables were defined in the crown fire initiation model of Van Wagner. Both surface fire intensity and crown fire initiation were strongly related to the weather components and weakly related to the fuel components, due to much greater variability in weather than fuel, and stronger relationship to the fire behavior mechanisms for weather than for fuel. Fire intensity was correlated to annual area burned; large area burned years had higher fire intensity predictions than smaller area burned years. The reason for this difference was attributed directly to the weather variable frequency distribution, which was shifted towards more extreme values in years in which large areas burned. During extreme weather conditions, the relative importance of fuels diminishes since all stands achieve the threshold required to permit crown fire development. This is important since most of the area burned in subalpine forests has historically occurred during very extreme weather (i.e., drought coupled to high winds). The fire behavior relationships predicted in the models support the concept that forest fire behavior is determined primarily by weather variation among years rather than fuel variation associated with stand age.","UNIV CALGARY,KANANASKIS FIELD STN,CALGARY,AB T2N 1N4,CANADA","BESSIE, WC (corresponding author), UNIV CALGARY,DEPT BIOL SCI,DIV ECOL,CALGARY,AB T2N 1N4,CANADA.",414,73,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","APR",1995,76,"3",NA,NA,NA,747,"762",NA,"10.2307/1939341",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Considerable annual variation in fish density occurred in the stream over the 10-yr period, particularly in pool habitats. Increased fish density was associated with increased stream discharge and creation of beaver ponds downstream from the study site. Weir traps used to monitor directional (upstream vs. downstream) fish movement during the last 4 yr of the study indicated annual changes in fish density were associated with the amount of fish dispersal occurring along the stream segment. Downstream fish movement, out of an upstream beaver pond occurred primarily during periods of elevated stream discharge. Upstream movement, out of a downstream beaver pond, occurred over a broader range of discharge conditions. A controlled, ''split-stream,'' experiment examining the effect of very low vs. elevated discharge on upstream fish movement indicated, however, that upstream movement of fish out of beaver ponds was also reduced by very low discharge conditions. Movement data for individual fish species revealed considerable variation among the taxa in the tendency for downstream vs. upstream movement, due to variation in the morphology of upstream vs. downstream beaver ponds and its subsequent effect on the composition of fish dispersing from these source areas. Most fish movement occurred over relatively brief time periods, suggesting life history and developmental processes were critical in influencing the timing of dispersal. Size structure of fishes captured in the stream indicated predominantly older age classes (>age I) of fish were dispersing along the stream. However, based on the occurrence of age 0 individuals only 1 of 12 species, the creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), routinely reproduced in the stream. Experiments conducted in an artificial stream located below one of the beaver ponds indicated discharge and fish predation have potentially strong and interactive effects on invertebrate colonization in stream ecosystems. Differences in colonization of riffles and pools under low vs. elevated discharge and fish vs. no-fish treatments suggested, however, that the interactive effect of these factors on invertebrate colonization was variable over even small spatial scales. Elevated discharge increased invertebrate colonization in riffles but decreased invertebrate colonization in pools. Contrary to intuitive expectations, fish predation reduced invertebrate colonization more under elevated than low discharge conditions, particularly in pool habitats. Taken together, these results suggest: (1) beaver ponds act as reproductive ''sources'' for fish on the landscape, while adjacent stream environments act as potential reproductive ''sinks,'' (2) large-scale spatial relationships between beaver ponds and streams, along with the influence of discharge on the permeability of the boundaries between these habitats, are critical in controlling fish dispersal between ponds and streams and the subsequent abundance and composition of fish in lotic ecosystems, and (3) fish predation and discharge have potentially cascading effects on invertebrate colonization in lotic ecosystems.",NA,"SCHLOSSER, IJ (corresponding author), UNIV N DAKOTA,DEPT BIOL,UNIV STN,GRAND FORKS,ND 58202, USA.",106,66,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","APR",1995,76,"3",NA,NA,NA,908,"925",NA,"10.2307/1939356",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Two alternative hypotheses were specifically addressed: (1) organic matter derived from the surface stream supports hyporheic respiration, and (2) detritus buried during flash floods supports hyporheic respiration. As predicted for the surface-derived organic matter hypothesis, respiration was lowest immediately following flash floods and increased significantly with time after flood (P < 0.001). Hyporheic respiration ranged from 0.05 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) immediately following a flash flood to as high as 4.41 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) late in algal succession. Respiration was significantly correlated with surface algal biomass during two spring/summer successional sequences (P < 0.05; partial correlation coefficients 0.58 and 0.88). Respiration was also consistently higher in downwelling than upwelling zones with overall mean rates of 1.12 and 0.46 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1), respectively. Respiration exhibited a distinct diel pattern with highest rate coinciding with time of maximum photosynthesis and was also significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration (P < 0.05), further supporting the hypothesis of hyporheic dependence on algal production. Flash floods bury organic matter that is also respired in the hyporheic zone; however, based upon storage of organic carbon immediately following floods, an average of only 15% of the observed respiration could be supported. We conclude that hyporheic respiration in Sycamore Creek is tightly linked to surface production. It is spatially distributed in biotic ''hot spots'' where surface waters enter hyporheic sediments and is most likely supported by organic matter that is supplied as dissolved organic carbon, perhaps from algal production.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287",NA,160,29,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","APR",1995,76,"3",NA,NA,NA,942,"952",NA,"10.2307/1939358",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The relative benefits for such cooperation vary across environmental and social contexts and thus foundresses should shift reproductive strategies when contexts change. An experimental study of 10 field populations of P. dominulus provides evidence for such strategy shifts. P. dominulus females displayed three basic alternative reproductive strategies: initiate a nest alone or as a dominant on a multifoundress nest, join as a subordinate, or refrain from nesting and instead ''sit-and-wait'' for reproductive opportunities to open later in the season. In our populations, joining likely yields inclusive fitness benefits by increasing colony survival and resistance to usurpation. Nevertheless, joiners and other foundresses readily moved to improve their situations by (1) adopting orphaned nests. (2) switching to larger nests, and (3) usurping small nests, which may have had a weakened foundress or a foundress with relatively low motivation for nest defense. Joining occurring more often early in the season, and adopting and usurping occurring more often later were consistent with inclusive fitness maximization. Lost past investments in nests did not affect future decisions. Overall, residents of nests were larger than the wasps that joined them, but this difference decreased over the course of the season. Wasps that had cooperated in the past to form multifoundress associations were more likely to renest (usually together) after removal of their original nest than were single foundresses. After nest loss, single foundresses were more likely than multiple foundresses to take over another wasp's nest by adoption or usurpation. Cooperation within multifoundress associations is facultative and the balance between cooperation and conflict theoretically depends on the asymmetry in reproduction resulting from the asymmetry in dominance. P. dominulus cofoundresses closer in size (less asymmetrical in dominance) added cells to their nests more slowly and produced significantly smaller nests and fewer workers than associations with more size variation, as would be predicted by greater conflict between wasps that are closer in size. The decline in size differences between joining wasps and residents suggests that late-season joiners were relatively large wasps seeking to dominate residents. Conflict on the nest may also explain why multiple foundresses disappeared from nests at a higher rate than did single foundresses. In sum, the multiple reproductive options of P. dominulus lead to a dynamic and flexible balance between cooperation and conflict in their social interactions.","HARVARD UNIV, MUSEUM COMPARAT ZOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",NA,72,20,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1995,76,"3",NA,NA,NA,953,"967",NA,"10.2307/1939359",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Seed banks are theoretically important to both the demography and genetic structure of plant populations. The presence of seed dormancy can also affect the evolution of traits not directly associated with dormancy and germination. Theoretical models have suggested that the existence of dormancy can influence the rate of evolution of post-germination traits. The eventual outcome (e,g., allele frequencies) may be influenced as well, leading to adaptive syndromes of germination and post-germination traits. Seeds that germinate in different conditions may experience different selective regimes for post-germination traits. If there an trade-offs between the fitness of post-germination traits in different environments, then seeds that germinate in the environment to which their post-germination traits are adapted will be at a selective advantage. If differences in germination and post-germination traits are genetically based, then potentially adaptive genetic correlations between germination and post-germination traits may evolve. We feel that investigating the ecological and evolutionary importance of these correlations requires an empirical approach. As a first step, hen we ask whether the conditions necessary for such syndromes to arise exist in a particular plant population. We show that conditions favoring the joint evolution of dormancy and postgermination traits leading to adaptive syndromes exist in the mustard, Lesquerella fendleri, in central New Mexico. First, Lesquerella experiences the sort of variation in environmental conditions that would be expected to lead to adaptive trade-offs in the expression of post-germination traits for individuals that differ in germination traits, Annual precipitation varies greatly from year to year so that germination in drier years would be expected to select for more xerophytic traits. Within a year, microenvironmental spatial variation exists. Lesquerella growth and reproduction are sensitive to both year-to-year and microenvironmental variation. Second, the seed bank can affect both the demographic and genetic structure of the population. Dormant seeds remain viable for at least 3 yr and can mitigate the negative demographic effects of reproductive failure. Allozyme differences exist between seeds that germinate in the field and seeds that remain dormant, suggesting that the evolutionary potential of the aboveground population is influenced by dormancy. Finally, the necessary genetic and environmental variation is present. Both germination percentage and post-germination traits (e.g., leaf morphology) vary among and within populations as well as among environmental treatments. Thus, the potential exists for Lesquerella to respond to selective differences between different temporal or spatial environments. We suggest experimental approaches for assessing the extent to which seed dormancy has affected or will affect the evolution of post-germination traits. The consequences of past evolution could be explored by asking ''What genetic and phenotypic differences exist between individuals that germinate and those that remain dormant?'', while controlling for factors that influence germination (maternal genotype, maternal environment, and germination environment). Exploring whether evolution is currently occurring would require an assessment of natural selection and the genetic potential for response to selection. Given the difficulty of such studies, a reasonable first step would be to explore how evolution can occur by performing an artificial selection experiment on dormancy or germination percentage. Then, correlated responses of post-germination traits could be examined. Empirical studies such as these are necessary in order to better understand the role of seed banks in plant ecology and evolution. Then, once associations that can be interpreted as adaptive syndromes are documented, questions about the ecological mechanisms (e.g., necessary frequencies of different year types) and genetic mechanisms (e.g., linkage disequilibrium vs. pleiotropy) can be explored. We hope to draw attention to seed dormancy, which is an often-ignored stage in the life history of plants, and to encourage empirical work, which lags far behind theory.",NA,"EVANS, AS (corresponding author), UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA.",100,33,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1995,76,"2",NA,NA,NA,344,"356",NA,"10.2307/1941194",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Despite its potential importance, parasite-induced host mortality has rarely been studied experimentally under natural conditions. We conducted a series of field releases of Drosophila putrida and Duosophila neotestacea that had been parasitized in the laboratory by the nematode Howardula aoronymphium. In 11 out of 12 independent tests, the proportion of flies that were parasitized declined significantly through time, suggesting that parasites cause host mortality. Independent tests showed that parasites have no detectable effect on dispersal of flies and that motherworms do not disappear from surviving hosts, thus supporting the conclusion that parasites cause significant host mortality in the field. Host mortality rate increased with worm burden, significantly so in four independent tests. This is a possible mechanism for density-dependent regulation of these parasite populations. Parasite-induced mortality was considerably greater among flies that had been released in the field than among those kept concurrently in the laboratory. Thus, laboratory or clinical trials may not provide an accurate assessment of parasite virulence in natural populations.

The relative importance of these possible adaptations was investigated in the wintergreen dwarf shrub Rhododendron lapponicum by analyses of responses of growth and nutrient allocation to early and late spring defoliation and to natural reduction of leaf biomass following flowering. Removal of old leaves at the time of budbreak had no effect on biomass accumulation and nutrient pools of the new shoots 1 mo later, although the defoliation prevented the transport of resorbed nutrients from old leaves to the new shoots. This transport accounted for by far the largest part of the increase in shoot N and P in undefoliated controls. Extra nutrients were not transported from stems and roots to compensate for the lost import from old leaves. Hence, defoliated plants compensated for the losses solely by increasing nutrient uptake. In contrast, defoliation 3 wk earlier caused a 29% reduction of annual shoot growth and a proportional decline of nutrient pools in the shoots, while the nutrient concentrations, reflecting the shoot nutrient status, did not decline. Almost identical responses were observed in unmanipulated plants the year after heavy flowering. Reproductive branches do not form leaves, resulting in a decreasing photosynthetic capacity and a reduction of resource storage and allocation to next year's leaf cohort. Although early and late spring defoliation caused equal losses of mobile nutrients, only the early defoliation decreased growth, suggesting that it was the loss of carbon rather than nutrients that affected growth. This supports earlier observations that the extended retention time of leaves in wintergreen and evergreen species plays a greater role in improving the carbon balance than in supplying the new leaves with nutrients.",NA,"JONASSON, S (corresponding author), UNIV COPENHAGEN, INST BOT, DEPT PLANT ECOL, OSTER FARIMAGSGADE 2D, DK-1353 COPENHAGEN K, DENMARK.",45,13,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1995,76,"2",NA,NA,NA,475,"485",NA,"10.2307/1941206",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Similar analyses are common in econometric studies, and serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the common adjustment approaches, especially for estimating the slope of a linear regression when the explanatory variable has a time trend. Use of a bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation, either in an adjusted t test or in a two-stage approach, outperformed other methods, including maximum likelihood and bootstrap estimators, in terms of confidence interval coverage. The bias correction was, however, sometimes awkward to apply. It was generally better to test for autocorrelation at the 0.5 level and use ordinary least squares if the test was not significant, although this pretesting mainly helped for weak autocorrelation and small sample sizes. For the best methods, the coverage was sometimes still substantially less than the stated 95% when autocorrelation was strong, even for sample sizes as large as 50. This was true for estimates of the mean, the regression intercept, and, when the explanatory variable had a time trend, the slope. Simulation results and an example show that different adjustment methods can produce substantially different estimates and confidence intervals.

I restricted my analysis to three periods of the chick's postembryonic development, during which the conflict between allocation of energy to P vs. R is most likely to occur: (a) when the greatest proportion of assimilated energy is allocated to growth; (b) when growth rate (in grams per day), or (c) energy allocated to growth (in kilojoules per day) are at absolute maxima. I analyzed the correlation between P and R after accounting for differences in body mass, costs of biosynthesis, mode of development, breeding latitude, and phylogeny. Under assumption of production efficiency of 0.75, the correlations were negative for periods (a) and (b), and statistically insignificant for period (c).

I conclude that predictions stemming from (1-3) can often be difficult to distinguish, which may account for the inconsistency between the results of different studies in which the relationship between P and R was analyzed.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES, SCH MED, DEPT PHYSIOL, LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 USA",NA,23,14,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1995,76,"1",NA,NA,NA,8,"19",NA,"10.2307/1940627",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

These species were all songbirds (Order Passeriformes) ranging in mass from 7 to 57 g. Using Jolly-Seber stochastic models for open populations, we estimated annual survival rate, population size, and recruitment between sampling periods for each species. We then explored relationships between these parameters and attributes such as body size, phylogenetic affiliation, foraging guild, and social behavior. Larger birds had comparatively long life-spans and low recruitment, but body size was not associated with population size. After adjusting for effects of body size, we found no association between phylogenetic affiliation and any demographic trait. Ecological attributes, especially foraging guild, were more clearly associated with interspecific variation in all demographic traits. Ant-followers had comparatively long life-spans, but species that participate in flocks did not live longer than solitary species. The allometric associations we observed were consistent with those demonstrated in other studies of vertebrates; thus, these relationships appear to be robust. Our finding that ecological factors were more influential than phylogenetic affiliation contrasts with comparative studies of temperate-zone birds and suggests that the relative importance of environmental vs. historical factors varies geographically.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST, BALBOA, PANAMA; UNIV WASHINGTON, INST ENVIRONM STUDIES, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; NATL BIOL SURVEY, PATUXENT WILDLIFE RES CTR, LAUREL, MD 20708 USA",NA,58,29,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1995,76,"1",NA,NA,NA,41,"51",NA,"10.2307/1940630",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I transplanted two recently diverged stickleback species (Gasterosteus sp.) and their Hybrids between habitats to test three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) the form of natural selection on feeding traits should differ between resource environments; (2) fitness trade-offs should occur between morphs specialized for different resources; (3) feeding efficiency should be the basis of fitness differences between morphs. Growth rate was used as a surrogate component of fitness. All three predictions were upheld. The larger of the two species (the Benthic), which has a larger mouth, deeper body, and fewer, shorter gill rakers than the second species (the Limnetic), had a twofold growth advantage in the littoral zone of the lake. This pattern was reversed in the open-water habitat, where the Limnetic species grew at double the rate of the Benthic. Hybrids, which are morphologically intermediate, tended to be intermediate in growth in both habitats. Growth rates were closely predicted by earlier laboratory measurements of feeding efficiency of the three forms in the same habitats, thus linking growth (and probably fitness) with feeding performance and morphology. I compare the strengths of the present approach with other methods that have been used to test the role of resources in adaptive radiation. I also argue that steep trade-offs in fitness along the littoral-open-water habitat gradient have two further consequences. First, they may cause Hybrids to have low fitness, allowing Benthics and Limnetics to coexist in the absence of perfect premating isolation between them. Second, they may promote ecological character displacement. Steep trade-offs may thus help explain why divergence along the littoral-open-water gradient is so common in fish that have colonized low-diversity lakes.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,CTR BIODIVERS,VANCOUVER,BC V6T 1Z4,CANADA","SCHLUTER, D (corresponding author), UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT ZOOL,6270 UNIV BLVD,VANCOUVER,BC V6T 1Z4,CANADA.",335,96,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JAN",1995,76,"1",NA,NA,NA,82,"90",NA,"10.2307/1940633",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Here we show that these same compounds also may prevent fouling organisms from colonizing the surface of this alga. In the field, Dictyota menstrualis plants were less frequently and less heavily fouled than any of the other common seaweed species investigated. In laboratory assays, larvae of the common fouling bryozoan Bugula neritina failed to settle on Dictyota even though they contacted its surface as often as they contacted the surface of a preferred host alga. Rejection occurred only after direct contact with the alga's surface. Rejection of Dictyota was not mediated by water-borne chemical cues or by surface wettability (a physical property of the surface that can affect fouling). The lipid-soluble extract from surface rubbings of Dictyota inhibited larval settlement when placed on other surfaces and contained the diterpene alcohols pachydictyol A and dictyol E. Larvae exposed to these compounds experienced mortality, abnormal development, or reduced rates of development. Although the potential for chemically mediated coevolution between plants and herbivores has been the focus of scores of previous investigations, such coevolution will depend on selection altering the chemical defenses of the plant following the evolution of resistance by herbivores. Such a reciprocal response will be constrained if compounds play multiple roles that are ecologically important. Dictyota produces secondary metabolites that are broadly defensive against a wide variety of consumers and fouling organisms. Although certain consumers may evolve resistance to these metabolites, it is unclear that feeding by these consumers will result in reciprocal responses from the plant. We suggest that coevolved interactions may be uncommon, and that many interactions that appear to be coevolved may result from fortuitous and opportunistic preadaptations.","UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA",NA,205,46,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1995,76,"1",NA,NA,NA,107,"123",NA,"10.2307/1940635",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

During the dry season, however, they are secretive, and a previous study revealed that during this season they remain perched in trees and have field metabolic rates only 28% of the wet season levels. Body temperatures (T-b's) of the lizards were measured by radio telemetry throughout the day during the wet and dry seasons. The midday T-b's during the wet season were high (grand mean = 36.7 degrees C) and typical for heliothermic lizards, but the dry season midday T-b's were significantly lower (grand mean = 32.8 degrees C). Microclimatic data and physical characteristics of the lizards were used in a biophysical model to calculate the operative temperatures (T-e) of lizards in the shade, in the sun on a horizontal plane, and normal to the sun at each hour of the day for the two seasons. The T-e's revealed the physical possibility for the lizards to achieve much higher T-b's during the dry season than were measured. Thus, the lower T-b's in the dry season represent a shift in preference rather than an inability to attain a high T-b during the cooler dry season. Inspection of the T-b's and T-e's revealed that although the lizards remained cooler in the dry season, they did not thermoregulate at the lowest possible T-b's. During both seasons the lizards basked in the sun early and late in the day, but during the dry season the lizards stopped intensive basking at a T-b approximate to 4 degrees C lower than in the wet season. An index of the extent to which the lizards exploit the available thermal environment indicates that they thermoregulate carefully in both seasons. T-b's were also measured in a laboratory thermal gradient during both seasons, and the T-b's selected during the dry season were significantly lower than those selected in the wet season. This suggests that the seasonal shift in thermal preference is an acclimatization response or an endogenous seasonal cycle rather than a response to a simple thermal cue. The lower T-b's in the dry season result in a conservation of energy and water during a season when these resources are relatively scarce. However, the fact that the lizards do not thermoregulate at the lowest possible T-b's suggests that the dry season T-b's represent a compromise between conservation of resources and the ability to perform other functions such as escape predators and/or digest food.",NA,"CHRISTIAN, KA (corresponding author), NO TERR UNIV, FAC SCI, POB 40146, CASUARINA, NT 0811, AUSTRALIA.",107,47,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JAN",1995,76,"1",NA,NA,NA,124,"132",NA,"10.2307/1940636",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The two predators were functionally equivalent, eliminating Bufo and Hyla, while leaving Pseudacris to numerically dominate ponds with salamanders. Effects of both predators also cascaded down to algal primary producers, which became more abundant where predators reduced the abundance of herbivorous tadpoles. Combined impacts of the two predator species on the survival of Pseudacris were less than that predicted by an additive model of the effects of each predator measured in the absence of the other, but greater than predicted by a multiplicative model of joint predator effects. Reduced growth of Ambystoma with Notophthalmus provides one possible mechanism for the observed shift to less than additive per capita predator effects.

In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species. I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance. Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",NA,143,32,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","TEMPE","ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287","JAN",1995,76,"1",NA,NA,NA,150,"164",NA,"10.2307/1940638",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I investigated how thermal environment affects the interaction between the early-blooming daffodil, Narcissus longispathus (Amaryllidaceae) and its major bee pollinator (Andrena bicolor; Andrenidae), focusing simultaneously on plant and pollinator sides of the interaction. I studied fruit and seed set, flower duration, and the intrafloral thermal environment of N. longispathus, and the thermal biology, foraging behavior, and thermoregulatory ability of A. bicolor over a 6-yr period in southeastern Spain. N. longispathus flowers from February to April, when unsuitable weather often limits pollinator activity, yet most flowers are successfully pollinated in all years and sites. Fruit set was weakly pollen limited, but among flowers setting fruit the proportion of ovules developing into seeds was not. Individual flowers lasted for 17 d on average, remaining functional during this period. On sunny days, the air inside N. longispathus flowers was significantly warmer than outside. Mean temperature excess inside flowers was as high as 8 degrees C, and was positively related to solar irradiance. Within flowers, air temperature was highest around the anthers; this intrafloral gradient was consistent with variation among perianth parts in radiation transmittance. Andrena bicolor foraged in N. longispathus flowering patches only on sunny days with air temperature >12 degrees-13 degrees C, and foraging behavior and flower visitation rate were temperature dependent. Bees were able to fly at relatively low thoracic temperatures (T-th; range 22 degrees-31 degrees C) and this was essential for successfully foraging at N. longispathus. Under the range of irradiance and air temperature found at foraging sites, A. bicolor individuals inside flowers were able to reach T-th suitable for flight by passive means alone. Under laboratory conditions, A. bicolor was unable to raise or otherwise regulate T-th by physiological means, but free-flying individuals thermoregulated behaviorally. Basking was used to raise T-th and intrafloral microclimate, by influencing the proportion of foraging time devoted to basking, played an important role in thermoregulation. Flower visitation rate was positively related to the average temperature inside visited flowers, and the probability of basking immediately after one floral visit declined with increasing flower temperature.

As a consequence, we know little about the factors that determine male reproductive success. If marine organisms compete for fertilizations (as do many terrestrial organisms), then a male's reproductive success should be reduced by the presence of other males. We tested this hypothesis via in situ experiments employing allozyme markers for both a colonial ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri) and a bryozoan (Celleporella hyalina). Under moderate density conditions, the presence of closer male-functioning colonies reduced the fertilization success of more distant males in both species. In C. hyalina, male fertilization success also increased with allocation to sperm production. In addition, selfing rates in this species were negatively correlated with the abundance of outcross sperm. These results suggest that male reproductive success in sessile marine invertebrates must be assessed as a function of the gamete output and spatial distribution of other males in a population, and that the performance of isolated males may yield overestimates of male fertilization success in natural populations.","SUNY STONY BROOK,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT,STONY BROOK,NY 11794","YUND, PO (corresponding author), UNIV NEW ORLEANS,DEPT BIOL SCI,NEW ORLEANS,LA 70148, USA.",85,21,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1994,75,"8",NA,NA,NA,2151,"2167",NA,"10.2307/1940874",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long-term (1962-1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food-web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system. We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (approximate to 20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The ''intermediate disturbance hypothesis'' does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow-water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after a major disturbance), Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization. We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying ''keystone'' species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA","TANNER, JE (corresponding author), JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND, DEPT MARINE BIOL, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA.",135,145,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","DEC",1994,75,"8",NA,NA,NA,2204,"2219",NA,"10.2307/1940877",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To address this, we developed formulae to estimate ''pre-interactive'' species prevalences permitting a more sensitive quantification of community structure. Nonetheless, if a null model deviates from the community that we base it on, it is difficult to separate the effects of heterogeneity in recruitment from competition. We have developed a method to test for each independently. Applying our analytical techniques to a well-studied guild of larval trematodes in the salt marsh snail Cerithidea californica revealed that competitive interactions among species were the most significant structuring force.

Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and red maple C4. rubrum) increased branch numbers, leaf numbers, and total leaf areas in gaps, especially large gaps, while sugar maple (A. saccharum) showed much smaller changes. Red maple tended to increase the number of leaves while leaf size decreased; striped maple increased leaf number but held leaf size constant. Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis by these species differed within and between gap and understory sites. Red maple showed higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than striped and sugar maple in all site/plot combinations except the large-gap south plots, where striped maple exceeded red maple. Estimated diurnal shoot-level assimilation differentiated species more than unit area assimilation rates and also altered the rank order of performance, with striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north. Population-level assimilation vs. irradiance response curves exhibited a similar pattern, with red maple dominating unit area rates in most plot microsites. In contrast, shoot assimilation curves showed striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north, where red maple > striped maple. Architectural variation among these species interacted with leaf-level assimilation rates to produce some differences among these species in shoot-level assimilation across the gap understory microclimatic gradient. Since survival and growth patterns are usually correlated with differences in whole-plant carbon assimilation, our results suggest that there is some photosynthetic potential for gap partitioning among these three species of Acer.","HARVARD UNIV, DEPT ORGANISM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, BIOL LABS, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",NA,86,18,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1994,75,"8",NA,NA,NA,2318,"2332",NA,"10.2307/1940887",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Simmondsia chinensis, jojoba, a dioecious desert shrub, is dimorphic in secondary sexual characters in some desert populations, where females on average have larger leaves and more open canopies than males. The function of this sexual dimorphism was examined by investigating the importance of shoot morphology to reproductive components of plant fitness. The reproductive behavior of individuals tended to be associated with different morphological attributes for both males and females. Males with more ''male-type'' morphology tended to have more inflorescences and a greater likelihood of flowering than did males structured more like females, though they also had smaller inflorescences. Females with more ''female-type'' construction produced more flower buds in one of the study years and also produced heavier seeds than females with more male-like structure. Females from four different morphological classes allocated 1.5-4.5 times as much to reproduction as did males, but showed wide variability in whether or not they set fruit. Therefore females either had a much higher or a much smaller reproductive allocation than most males. Fruit set in the population studied is not limited by pollen availability, but is presumably constrained by abiotic resource availability. The asymmetry between sexes in the morphology of reproductively more successful individuals points to a potential for a resource-based evolutionary origin of sexual dimorphism in jojoba, arising from different morphological optima for each sex.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024",NA,60,21,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1994,75,"8",NA,NA,NA,2384,"2394",NA,"10.2307/1940892",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We studied recruitment in the marsh elder, Iva frutescens, to examine the relationship between positive and negative forces in recruitment. Marsh elder seedling establishment was competitively precluded in undisturbed habitats by the dense perennial turfs that dominate marsh habitats. Adult marsh elders, however, passively trapped tidally transported plant debris that kills underlying vegetation. As a result, adult Iva created bare space and positively influenced seedling recruitment by facilitating the formation of seedling safe sites. Within bare patches, Iva seedling survivorship was high under adult conspecifics and at high seedling densities. In contrast, solitary Iva seedlings without adult neighbors suffered extremely high mortality. These positive associations among neighbors were experimentally shown to result from neighbor buffering of hypersaline soil conditions. Salinities in unshaded bare patches were elevated due to increased exposure to radiation and surface evaporation. Both adult nurse plants and high seedling densities shaded the soil, ameliorated high soil salinities, and thus had positive effects on seedling performance. Under adult canopies or when soil salinities were experimentally reduced by shading or watering, positive associations did not occur and all interactions among seedlings or between seedlings and adults were competitive. Our results indicate that marsh plant recruitment is dictated by a balance between positive and negative forces. Moreover, since positive interactions were only seen once densities and physical forces had been experimentally manipulated, our results warn that positive interactions may be important forces in assemblages even where they are not conspicuous. These findings contribute to growing evidence that positive interactions, particularly those mediated by neighbor amelioration of harsh physical conditions, are important community level processes in a wide range of plant and animal assemblages.",NA,"BERTNESS, MD (corresponding author), BROWN UNIV, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, PROVIDENCE, RI 02912 USA.",125,39,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1994,75,"8",NA,NA,NA,2416,"2429",NA,"10.2307/1940895",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This was investigated by regressions of biomass and rainfall on each other, and of these variables separately on each of three different measures of variation in plant community composition, Two of these measures, principal components analysis scores based on variation in species abundance and the ratio by mass of nongrass/grass species, showed significant relationships with biomass variation on many experimental plots, although relationships with rainfall were relatively slight or nonexistent. The third measure employed similarity indices to detect changes in species composition in response to variation in biomass, but failed to find any. Biomass was significantly increased by rainfall on all plots. We propose that variation in community composition was more closely related to biomass variation than to rainfall because rainfall selectively favored the grasses in the community, which we believe competed asymmetrically (for light) with the other species when rainfall was high. The severity of this competition would depend upon biomass more directly than upon rainfall, although it is rainfall that enhanced grass growth. In effect, asymmetric competition magnified the effect of rainfall on community composition.","OPEN UNIV,DEPT STAT,MILTON KEYNES MK7 6AA,BUCKS,ENGLAND; ROTHAMSTED EXPTL STN,DEPT STAT,HARPENDEN AL5 2JQ,HERTS,ENGLAND; UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT PURE & APPL BIOL,ASCOT SL5 7PY,BERKS,ENGLAND","SILVERTOWN, J (corresponding author), OPEN UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MILTON KEYNES MK7 6AA,BUCKS,ENGLAND.",135,54,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1994,75,"8",NA,NA,NA,2430,"2437",NA,"10.2307/1940896",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Despite its importance in both theoretical and applied ecology, a formal and rigorous definition of SH is lacking. Such a definition is needed to facilitate quantitative analyses. To this end, we suggest that SH must be defined in terms of its underlying components. For categorical maps, SH is the complexity in five components: (1) number of patch types, (2) proportion of each type, (3) spatial arrangement of patches, (4) patch shape, and (5) contrast between neighboring patches. To illustrate the use of these components to develop a quantitative definition of SH, we used statistical models to produce categorical maps with known underlying SH characteristics. These simulated maps were analyzed in a factorial experiment to examine the effectiveness and sensitivity of four indices (i.e., fractal, contagion, evenness, patchiness) to detect patterns in these underlying components of SH. Our results show that any definition of SH is strongly dependent on the underlying variables and the methods used, that many indices depict different aspects of SH, that significant interactions exist among the five components of SH, and that some indices are strongly correlated. Quantification of spatial heterogeneity is essential to our understanding of the relationships between spatial heterogeneity and landscape functions and processes.

Some of these are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the well-documented global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover change. Human activity-now primarily fossil fuel combustion-has increased carbon dioxide concentrations from similar to 280 to 355 mu L/L since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000 yr, and several lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused. This increase is likely to have climatic consequences-and certainly it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer, also by legume crops and as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways combined. This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystems, contributes to eutrophication of the biosphere, and has effects on biological diversity in the most affected areas. Finally, human land use/land cover change has transformed one-third to one-half of Earth's ice-free surface. This in and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decades to come; it has profound effects on biological diversity on land and on ecosystems downwind and downstream of affected areas. Overall, any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystems and human-altered areas that may have existed in the past has vanished, and ecological research should account for this reality. These three and other equally certain components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population. On a broad scale, there is little uncertainty about any of these components of change or their causes. However, much of the public believes the causes-even the existence-of global change to be uncertain and contentious topics. By speaking out effectively, we can help to shift the focus of public discussion towards what can and should be done about global environmental change.",NA,"VITOUSEK, PM (corresponding author), STANFORD UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.",1227,1020,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1994,75,"7",NA,NA,NA,1861,"1876",NA,"10.2307/1941591",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Yet mechanisms of seed dispersal and survival of seeds in new areas remain poorly described. We conducted seed dispersal experiments in the field and laboratory to better describe seed dispersal characteristics in one species, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), the dominant seagrass species in the temperate zone of the United States, Japan, and Europe. Seeds were broadcast by hand into unvegetated 5 m diameter plots at three locations over 3 yr (1989-1991) in the York River, Virginia (Chesapeake Bay), These sites had been previously vegetated but were devoid of any vegetation prior to (since 1972) and during the course of the experiments. Resultant seedling distributions closely matched broadcast patterns, with 80% of all seedlings found within the 5 m diameter plots, despite the fact that geophysical processes would appear sufficient to transport seeds greater distances. Wind records for the 2-mo period between seed broadcasting and germination revealed time-averaged wind speeds in excess of 40 km/h on greater than or equal to 12 d in each of the 3 yr and gale-force winds (72 km/h) in 2 of 3 yr. A three-dimensional hydrographic computer simulation model of the York River provided instantaneous current velocity estimates from which maximum bottom shear velocities (u*) in the study area were approximated (flood tide: 1.26 cm/s, ebb tide: 1.20 cm/s). These estimates exceeded the critical erosion threshold (u*(crit) = 0.7 cm/s) for Z. marina seeds determined from laboratory flume experiments. We postulate that small-scale topographic features on the bottom (burrows, pits, mounds, ripples) shield the seeds from the flow. Our results suggest that seeds settle rapidly, dispersing only up to a few metres under the influence of currents and become rapidly incorporated into the sediment. The limited dispersal capabilities of seeds underscore the need to address restoration goals and questions of seagrass ecology in the context of landscape-scale distributional patterns and metapopulation analyses.",NA,"ORTH, RJ (corresponding author), COLL WILLIAM & MARY,SCH MARINE SCI,VIRGINIA INST MARINE SCI,GLOUCESTER POINT,VA 23062, USA.",237,84,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1994,75,"7",NA,NA,NA,1927,"1939",NA,"10.2307/1941597",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Green Published","2021-05-12"

The differentiation of the soil communities was evident in measurements of plant survival, phenology, growth, and root-shoot ratios. Effects on survival and growth suggest negative feedbacks between these species and the soil communities that they culture. Survival rates of Krigia dandelion were significantly reduced when grown with their ''own'' soil community. Considered as a whole, the three other species (all grasses) had significantly lower growth and root-shoot ratios when grown with soil communities started with their own inocula compared to soil communities started with the inocula of other species. However, the significance of this effect on growth rate and root-shoot ratios was due primarily to the pairwise comparison of Anthoxanthum odoratum and Danthonia spicata and of Anthoxanthum and Panicum sphaerocarpon, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of Danthonia and Panicum do not suggest differential responses to each other's soils in growth rate or root-shoot ratios nor do soil communities appear to affect the relative competitive ability of these two species.

The occurrence of fungus in the diet reflected sporocarp production. When production was high, the animals were almost exclusively mycophagous, while at lower levels of production they added dicot fruit and leaf to the diet. Females were slightly but consistently more mycophagous than males. Body condition in both sexes tended to increase with increased representation of fungus in the diet.

The abundance of scorpions did not change significantly with habitat fragmentation and there was no discernible effect of remnant size. The abundance of amphipods in the remnants relative to that in the controls decreased markedly after fragmentation, more so on smaller remnants than on larger ones. By reason of their ecological and biological characteristics, scorpions seem resistant to the changed ecological conditions brought about by habitat fragmentation, at least in the short term, whereas amphipods are more susceptible.

Usual estimates of this quantity from field sampling data assume that the probability of appearing in the capture or count statistic is the same for animals that do and do not breed. A similar assumption is required by most existing methods used to test ecologically interesting hypotheses about reproductive costs using field sampling data. However, in many field sampling situations breeding and nonbreeding animals are likely to exhibit different probabilities of being seen or caught. In this paper, we propose the use of multistate capture-recapture models for these estimation and testing problems. This methodology permits a formal test of the hypothesis of equal capture/sighting probabilities for breeding and nonbreeding individuals. Two estimators of breeding proportion (and associated standard errors) are presented, one for the case of equal capture probabilities and one for the case of unequal capture probabilities. The multistate modeling framework also yields formal tests of hypotheses about reproductive costs to future reproduction or survival or both fitness components. The general methodology is illustrated using capture-recapture data on female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. Resulting estimates of the proportion of reproductively active females showed strong seasonal variation, as expected, with low breeding proportions in midwinter. We found no evidence of reproductive costs extracted in subsequent survival or reproduction. We believe that this methodological framework has wide application to problems in animal ecology concerning breeding proportions and phenotypic reproductive costs.","N CAROLINA STATE UNIV, INST STAT, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA","NICHOLS, JD (corresponding author), US FISH & WILDLIFE SERV, PATUXENT WILDLIFE RES CTR, NATL BIOL SURVEY, LAUREL, MD 20708 USA.",185,43,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","OCT",1994,75,"7",NA,NA,NA,2052,"2065",NA,"10.2307/1941610",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilize, but aphallics cannot donate sperm because they do not develop a functional penis and prostate. Previous studies of the freshwater gastropod Bulinus truncatus (Mollusca: Pulmonata) suggest that in at least some laboratory populations, phally is determined by temperature during egg and hatchling stages, with colder temperatures favoring the development of euphally. Here we provide evidence for temperature-influenced phally determination in natural populations of B. truncatus in northern Nigeria. The prevalence of euphally across 49 populations ranged from 0 to 81%. Levels of euphally increased significantly both within and across sites as temperatures decreased during the dry-cool season. Across sites, time of year (date) was the strongest single predictor of proportion of euphallics. When the effects of time of year were controlled for, there was a significant negative correlation between temperature during phally development and proportion of euphallics. In addition, maximum water temperature during the Ist wk of the study predicted proportions of euphallics in the next snail generation. A laboratory study of snails from three of these populations demonstrated that temperature sensitivities differed between populations: one population that remained 100% aphallic over the course of held observations showed only low levels of temperature sensitivity in the laboratory, while a population that tripled in proportion of euphallics in the field showed strong levels of temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, individuals within populations varied in their temperature sensitivities.

We determined lambda(max) and NTR for reference simulations of planktivore- and piscivore-dominated food webs at three baseline phosphorus loading rates (0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1)), then measured recovery rates from simulated pulses of available phosphorus.

However, the piscivore-dominated (long) food web was more resilient at the highest baseline phosphorus loading rate (2.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1)), apparently because the additional nutrients were incorporated into biota more rapidly.

HOIs are considered potentially significant because their presence is assumed to mean that the dynamic behavior of a full community of species is unpredictable based on observations of interactions between subsets of the species within the community. Despite such attention, the causal mechanisms that produce HOIs have been inadequately discussed. We discuss three different usages of the term HOIs and provide insight as to why HOIs might be found within a given community. HOIs may be detected for three reasons: inappropriate assumptions made concerning species interactions that influence statistical tests, unmeasured parameters and variables, and interaction modifications (i.e., a functional change in the interaction of two species caused by a third species). This confusion concerning the defining attributes of HOIs has made their detection problematic. While the statistical tests being used in the ecological experiments to detect HOIs are described in detail in most papers, the dynamic models underlying these tests are often not made explicit. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalency of three different statistical tests: the Case and Bender (1981) test, analysis of variance, and a multiplicative test(Wootton 1994). However, the choice of a response variable (i.e., population densities, population growth rates, per-capita growth rates, etc.) and different data transformations applied to these response variables alter the underlying dynamics model that is being tested. The result is that the statistical test applied does not always perform the intended comparison but instead tests a different and sometimes unjustified or even inappropriate dynamic model. Finally, we review the relationship between indirect effects and HOIs. Whereas some researchers have lumped HOIs and indirect effects, we argue that the two represent completely unique and separate phenomena. Additionally, indirect effects can complicate detection of HOIs, and we review several methods by which to separate the two processes.",NA,"BILLICK, I (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT BIOL,0116,9500 GILMAN DR,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.",185,53,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1994,75,"6",NA,NA,NA,1529,"1543",NA,"10.2307/1939614",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This endeavor is likely to succeed only if the behavior of the component parts remains essentially the same regardless of the state of other elements in the system. For example, the behavior of multi-species communities is predictable from a knowledge of interactions among species pairs only if the functions describing the pairwise interactions are not modified by the abundance of other species in the community. Here I discuss some of the problems in identifying empirically whether such interaction modifications (''higher order interactions'') occur. Four persistent problems include (1) confusion about the definition of ''higher order interactions,'' (2) discrepancies between the currency typically used in theoretical work (instantaneous rates) and that required in empirical work (the states of variables [e.g., abundances] after a discrete time period), (3) frequent incongruities between statistical procedures and the underlying theory being tested, and (4) a failure to explicitly consider the theoretical framework being tested. Progress may be more rapid in the future if the theory being tested is specified, and if empirical investigations shift their focus toward identifying possible mechanisms by which interactions can be modified.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",NA,133,32,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1994,75,"6",NA,NA,NA,1544,"1551",NA,"10.2307/1939615",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Charnov and Finerty (1980) proposed that preferential behavior toward relatives drives population cycles through kin selection. Their hypothesis makes three assumptions: (1) individuals behaviorally discriminate kin from non-kin, (2) kin associate, and (3) kin benefit from this association. These assumptions were tested in female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) in eastern Kansas. An equal number of laboratory-born females and males were released into 12 fenced enclosures; 6 enclosures contained groups of littermate sisters and 6 contained groups of unrelated females. Space use, reproductive success, and survival were monitored during two replications of the experiment (Fall 1989 and Spring 1990). Female survival and reproductive success were not affected by relatedness, although more young were born in the Spring than in the Fall. Home range size and overlap were greater for females in related groups than those in unrelated groups. Home range size also was larger in the Fall than in the Spring. Prairie vole sisters associated spatially, but our measurements showed no fitness benefits conferred by these associations.

Elsewhere each species exists alone or in sympatry with one other jackal species. The fossil record suggests that the golden jackal evolved outside of Africa and joined the other two species in East Africa within the last 500 000 yr. Previous research showed that unlike other sympatric canids, all three jackal species in East Africa are extremely similar in size and overall morphology and thus exhibit no obvious evidence of ecological character displacement. Moreover, the three species do not form a monophyletic group, are distantly related, and thus may have had ample time to diverge morphologically. Here, we explore in further detail the possibility of character displacement in the three species by assessing variation in 62 measures of the skull and teeth for populations of all three species throughout their ranges. The expanded measurement and population sample allows us to explore four possible manifestations of character displacement: (1) divergence in size, (2) divergence in shape, (3) reduced morphological variability, and (4) reduced sexual dimorphism. There is no evidence of size divergence among jackals in East Africa; by contrast the three species appear to converge on a similar size. However, divergence in shape is apparent. The recent insinuation of golden jackals into the East African fauna has resulted in character divergence and probable niche compression of blackbacked jackals as evidenced by adaptations for increased carnivory, reduced sexual dimorphism, and reduced variability. The response has been asymmetric as the golden and sidestriped jackals have not diverged functionally or shown niche compression. The pattern of character displacement is likely a function of starting conditions at the time the three became sympatric. The golden jackal exhibits dietary adaptations intermediate to those of the other two species but more similar to those of blackbacked jackals. Thus character displacement was more likely to occur in goldens and blackbacks. Selection for increased carnivory in the blackbacked jackal might have been favored because of the abundance of vertebrate prey in the East African plains. The success of the golden jackal as an insinuator into East Africa suggests that the carnivore guild might not be saturated.",NA,"VANVALKENBURGH, B (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024, USA.",60,30,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1994,75,"6",NA,NA,NA,1567,"1581",NA,NA,15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

During the majority of surface activity, the nocturnal C. cerastes were either coiled on or partially buried in the sand waiting to ambush mobile prey, whereas the diurnal M. flagellum cruised through the habitat searching for active and sedentary prey. Average duration of daily surface activity of C. cerastes ((X) over bar +/- 1 SE = 7.2 +/- 0.7 h/d) was nearly twice that of M. flagellum (3.9 +/- 0.9 h/d). Body temperatures (T-b's) of active M. flagellum (33.1 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C) averaged higher, and were maintained within a narrower range, than those of active C. cerastes (25.3 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C). Field metabolic rates (FMR, as CO2 production), measured with doubly labeled water, were significantly greater in M. flagellum (body mass = 124 +/- 12 g [(X) over bar +/- 1 SE]) than in C. cerastes(125 +/- 6 g) during the active season (mid-April to mid-October; 0.154 +/- 0.017 vs. 0.063 +/- 0.005 mL.g(-1).h(-1)), transition seasons (mid-March to mid-April, mid-October to mid-November; 0.058 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.028 +/- 0.002 mL.g(-1).h(-1)), and hibernation (mid-November to mid-March, 0.014 +/- 0.002 vs. 0.007 +/- 0.001 mL.g(-1).h(-1)). Masticophis flagellum also possessed significantly greater rates of water influx than C. cerastes during the active (19.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.1 mL.kg(-1).d(-1)) and transition seasons (7.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.5 mL.g(-1).d(-1)). Standard metabolic rates (SMR), measured at six T-b's (10 degrees-35 degrees C), of M. flagellum averaged 37 +/- 4% greater than SMR of C. cerastes. The monthly metabolic cost of SMR, calculated by integrating 24-h T-b profiles with temperature-dependent regression equations for SMR, averaged 62 +/- 4% greater for free-ranging M. flagellum than for C. cerastes. The difference between FMR and SMR is the energy allocated to activities and other energy-demanding functions such as digestion and represented 65 and 76%, respectively, of the yearly metabolic expenditure of C. cerastes and M. flagellum. Annually, M. flagellum spent 2.6 times the amount of energy on activity and other functions as did C. cerastes. Contributing to expenditures above SMR were digestion (19-43% of FMR) and movement (6-18% of FMR). Feeding rate (calculated from water influx) during the active season of M. flagellum (24.1 +/- 5.5 g.kg(-1).d(-1)) was more than twice that of C. cerastes(9.4 +/- 1.4 g.kg(-1).d(-1)). Over a full year, M. flagellum consumed 2.1 times as much assimilable energy as did C. cerastes, although both species gained similar energy profits (212 and 177 kJ/yr, respectively). The foraging strategy of the cryptic, ambushing C. cerastes balances low energy expenditure with low food intake, whereas widely foraging M. flagellum have greater expenditures but achieve greater energy consumption, as well.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,BIOMED & ENVIRONM SCI LAB,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024",NA,163,33,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1994,75,"6",NA,NA,NA,1600,"1614",NA,"10.2307/1939621",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

I examined the interaction between the two species in a natural population in western Newfoundland, Canada. Experimental manipulations of rates of prey capture by pitcher-plant leaves indicated that both insect species are limited by carcass supply. However, the interaction between them is commensal rather than competitive. Midge growth was unaffected by experimental quadrupling of mosquito density in otherwise unmanipulated leaves. Mosquito growth, on the other hand, increased with midge density in both natural leaves and artificial leaf microcosms. This interaction is an example of a processing chain commensalism. Although both species feed on carcass material, they use it in different stages of decay: midges feed by chewing on solid material, while mosquitoes filter-feed on particles derived from the decaying matter. Consumption of particles by mosquitoes does not affect resource availability for midges, but feeding by midges does influence particle availability. In artificial leaf microcosms, high bacterial densities occurred sooner in artificial leaves with midges present than in identical leaves without them. Bacteria are a direct food source for mosquitoes, and high bacterial densities also indicate that other organic material is being comminuted, providing particles for mosquitoes and surface area for bacterial growth. Although midges remove some of the carcass resource that also limits mosquitoes, their net effect on mosquitoes is positive because they accelerate conversion of the remaining resource to particles.","UNIV PENN,DEPT BIOL,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104",NA,110,55,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1994,75,"6",NA,NA,NA,1647,"1660",NA,"10.2307/1939625",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To evaluate the relative defensive value of CaCO3, secondary metabolites, and the potential synergistic or additive effects of the two, we made artificial agar-based ''seaweeds'' in which we manipulated algal organic content, CaCO3, and the secondary metabolites produced by the calcified green seaweeds Rhipocephalus phoenix, Udotea cyathiformis, and Halimeda goreauii, all of which are relatively resistant to herbivores. The effects of these manipulations on herbivore feeding were evaluated using three different types of herbivores, the sea urchin Diadema antillarum, the amphipod Cymadusa filosa, and a mixed-species group of small parrotfishes. Addition of finely powdered CaCO3 as 69% of food dry mass had no effect on feeding by parrotfishes, deterred feeding by Cymadusa, and deterred Diadema when food organic content was low but not when it was higher. Although calcification of algal tissues has generally been considered a structural defense that hardens seaweed thalli and makes them more resistant to attack, the decreased feeding on CaCO3-containing foods in our assays occurred without any measurable alteration of food toughness. At natural concentrations, semipurified secondary metabolites from Rhipocephalus or Udotea deterred feeding by all three herbivores. In most assays, feeding was depressed more by the addition of metabolites from Rhipocephalus or Udotea than by the addition of CaCO3 even though CaCO3 was added at 1.3-2.2 times the natural concentration for these plants. In contrast, the major metabolite from Halimeda goreauii, when tested alone, did not affect feeding by any of the herbivores. In two of our nine assays, the synchronous combination of CaCO3 and secondary metabolites acted synergistically and deterred feeding significantly more than the sum of the effects of each tested separately. Mechanisms producing these synergisms are unknown, but it is possible that calcification could also be acting as a chemical defense by altering gut pH in ways that increase the potency of the secondary metabolites. It is common for chemical, structural, morphological, and nutritional deterrents to co-occur in individual prey species. For some plant-herbivore interactions, the combined effects of these characteristics can be much more than the sum of their separate effects.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG, LA JOLLA, CA 92093 USA","HAY, ME (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",330,118,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1994,75,"6",NA,NA,NA,1714,"1726",NA,"10.2307/1939631",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Total annual production (as dry mass) was among the highest reported for mayflies, ranging from 20.8 to 42.2 g/m(2) of snag surface (7.4 to 12.3 g/m(2) of channel bottom) in two consecutive years. Relatively little change occurred between years for four out of six families. Biomass turnover rates (annual production/biomass) were generally high, ranging from 8 (single generation per year) to 96 (multiple generations per year) for individual taxa. Distinct types of temporal production patterns occurred: (1) concentration in winter (Ephemerella argo, E. dorothea, Eurylophella sp., and Isonychia), (2) concentration in summer (Baetis ephippiatus, Tricorythodes sp., Caenis spp.), or (3) spread throughout the year and peaking in summer (Baetis intercalaris, Stenonema modestum, S. integrum, S. exiguum, and Hexagenia sp.). Temporal overlap of production, using the proportional similarity index, was highest among closely related taxa (>0.60), with the least overlap (<0.15) among taxa in different families. Overlap based upon the amount that various food types contribute to production was high among all species, suggesting even less resource partitioning for food than for time. Of the. annual food consumption (as dry mass) by mayflies per unit snag surface area (423 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), approximate to 87% consisted of amorphous detritus that is rapidly replenished on snags from floodplain-derived seston. This food source accounted for approximate to 70% of total mayfly production. We suggest that a fluctuating habitat (snags), a continuously replenished food supply, high biomass turnover, and high drift densities help perpetuate a persistent, resilient, and diverse mayfly assemblage with little resource partitioning.","GEORGIA INST TECHNOL,GEORGIA TECH RES INST,ATLANTA,GA 30332","BENKE, AC (corresponding author), UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT SCI BIOL,AQUAT BIOL PROGRAM,TUSCALOOSA,AL 35487, USA.",80,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1994,75,"5",NA,NA,NA,1219,"1232",NA,"10.2307/1937448",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In addition, specialist mesograzers experience reduced predation from fishes when living on seaweeds that produce these compounds. In this study we tested the hypothesis that generalist, as opposed to specialist, mesograzers can also benefit from reduced predation when they occupy chemically defended plants. Secondly, we assessed the hypothesis that low herbivore mobility, unconfounded by herbivore size or specialized feeding, selects for tolerance of seaweed chemical defenses, by comparing responses to the chemically defended brown seaweed Dictyota menstraulis of three sympatric, generalist amphipods that differ in mobility (Ampithoe longimana, Ampithoe valida, and Gamamruts mucronatus). Responses to Dictyota's chemical defenses varied as much among these three amphipods as among the phylogenetically distant fishes and mesograzers studied previously and supported the hypothesis that less mobile herbivores should be most tolerant of plant chemical defenses. In laboratory experiments, A. longimana moved little, preferentially consumed Dictyota over other seaweeds, and was unaffected by all Dictyota secondary metabolites tested. In contrast, G. mucronatus was active, it did not feed on Dictyota, and two of three Dictyota secondary metabolites deterred its grazing. Distribution of amphipods in the field suggested that these feeding patterns affected amphipod risk of predation. A. longimana reached its highest abundance on Dictyota, which is unpalatable to omnivorous fish predators, during the season when fish are most abundant. At the same time, the highly active C. mucronatus decreased to near extinction. Like G. mucronatus, A. valida was deterred by two Dictyota secondary metabolites, did not eat Dictyota, and disappeared when fishes were abundant. Experiments confirmed that A. longimana was less vulnerable to fish predation when occupying a chemically defended seaweed than when occupying a palatable seaweed. This decreased predation resulted primarily from a decreased frequency of encounter with predators when amphipods were on chemically defended plants. When we experimentally equalized encounter rates between omnivorous pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) and the seaweeds Dictyota menstrualis and Ulva curvata (unpalatable and palatable, respectively, to pinfish) in the laboratory, amphipods occupying these two plants were eaten at similar rates. In contrast, when live amphipods were affixed to Ulva and Dictyota and deployed in the held, amphipods survived only on Dictyota. Heavy fish grazing on Ulva in the latter experiment suggests that poor survival of amphipods on Ulva may have resulted from greater detection and/or incidental ingestion of amphipods on this plant, due to frequent visitation by fishes. Infrequent visitation of Dictyota by foraging fish also may explain A. longimana's persistence through the summer on this chemically defended seaweed while the two Ulva-associated amphipods declined precipitously. These results (1) confirm that association with chemically defended plants can reduce predation on generalist, as well as specialist, herbivores and (2) suggest that preferential feeding on chemically defended plants is most likely for sedentary mesograzers because low mobility enhances the ability to exploit chemically defended seaweeds as refuges from fish predation.","UNIV N CAROLINA,INST MARINE SCI,MOREHEAD CITY,NC 28557",NA,205,70,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1994,75,"5",NA,NA,NA,1304,"1319",NA,"10.2307/1937456",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The bullfrog is found in permanent ponds that typically contain fish, whereas the green frog is widely distributed along the gradient and is most successful in ponds where the bullfrog is absent. In a set of experimental ponds, bullfrogs were most abundant in ponds containing fish (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus) and were rare in permanent ponds that lacked fish. In contrast, green frogs were most abundant in ponds that had been drained the previous fall, second most abundant in those that lacked fish, and sparse in ponds containing bluegill. When presence and absence of bluegill were experimentally manipulated in divided ponds, bullfrogs survived well in the presence of bluegill, whereas no individuals survived in the absence of bluegill. Green frogs survived in low numbers under both treatments with a tendency to better survivorship in the absence of bluegill. A series of laboratory choice experiments was conducted with three major predator types: the dragonfly larva Anax junius, the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum, and L. macrochirus. Bullfrog larvae were more vulnerable to Anax and Ambystoma than were green frogs (because of higher activity levels), and green frogs were more vulnerable to bluegill than were bullfrogs (because tadpoles were less noxious). We argue that the high densities of bullfrogs found in the presence of bluegill reflect an indirect facilitation through two pathways: bluegill had strong negative effects on invertebrate and salamander predators of bullfrogs and on the green frog, which is a bullfrog competitor. The direct and indirect effects of these suites of predators appear to explain the differences in species abundances along the environmental gradient. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs at the individual level contributing to these differences in species performance along the gradient.","DARTMOUTH COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,HANOVER,NH 03755","WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",269,53,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1994,75,"5",NA,NA,NA,1368,"1382",NA,"10.2307/1937461",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In the Namib Desert, two species of rodent, a nocturnal dune hairy-footed gerbil, Gerbillurus tytonis, and a diurnal striped mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio, co-occur in a vegetated island in the dune sea. The species show a marked preference for the same microhabitat, although gerbils also inhabit a second microhabitat where predation risk is greater. We provide direct experimental evidence for the role of predation risk and both inter- and intraspecific competition in affecting foraging behavior and habitat selection of gerbils. Using two techniques (tracking and seed trays), we were able to show that gerbils decrease foraging activity in vegetated areas during periods of increased illumination (full-moon periods). Removal of a potential competitor, the striped mouse, as well as removal of conspecifics, resulted in a significant increase in gerbil foraging activity. We propose that high susceptibility to predation results in a shared preference for the safest habitat and leads to competition for limited resources.","DESERT ECOL RES UNIT NAMIBIA,GOBABEB,SWAKOPMUND,NAMIBIA",NA,103,28,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1994,75,"5",NA,NA,NA,1397,"1405",NA,"10.2307/1937463",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In this study we compared growth trajectories of the koinobiont ichneumonid endoparasitoid Venturia canescens developing in four larval instars of one of its hosts, the moth Plodia interpunctella. Hosts were reared with excess food and parasitized as late second, third, fourth, and fifth instars. Hosts were dissected at intervals after parasitism, and host and parasitoid dry mass determined. The survivorship, development time, and size of eclosing adult wasps were also monitored. Hosts parasitized by Venturia continued to grow and become prepupae, although their maximum masses were progressively smaller the earlier that the hosts were parasitized: second-instar (L2) hosts grew to 70% of control (unparasitized) size, while L4 and L5 hosts reached control size. The maximum larval dry mass, as well as eclosing adult size, varied with host instar at parasitism. Venturia larvae spent prolonged periods as first instars when developing from L2 hosts and grew most rapidly during early stages in L5 larvae. The data shaw that for Venturia, host duality is not a direct function of host size at parasitism.

To resolve this apparent paradox, phenology and seasonal changes in tree water status were monitored during two consecutive dry seasons in > 150 trees of 37 species growing at different sites in the tropical dry lowland forest of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Tree development during the dry season varied considerably between species and between sites of different moisture availability. Leaf shedding, flowering, and shoot growth (flushing) were strongly correlated with seasonal changes in tree water status, measured by conventional and newly developed techniques. Tree water status varied with the availability of subsoil water and a variety of biotic factors such as structure and life-span of leaves, time of leaf shedding, wood density and capacity for stem water storage, and depth and density of root systems. Observed tree species differed widely in wood density (from 0.19 to 1.1 g/cm(3)) and stem water storage capacity (400-20% of dry mass), which was highly correlated with the degree of desiccation during drought. Only hardwood trees at dry upland sites, lacking stem water storage and access to subsoil water, desiccated strongly (stem water potential < -4 MPa) and remained inactive throughout the dry season. In all other trees elimination of transpirational water loss during leaf shedding in conjunction with utilization of residual water enabled rehydration of stem tissues and subsequent flowering or flushing during the dry season. Rate and degree of rehydration varied strongly with the availability of water stored in tree trunks or in the subsoil. Stored water buffers the impact of seasonal drought and enables flowering and flushing during the dry season. Climatic data are thus not sufficient to explain tree phenology in seasonally dry tropical forests. Phenology, seasonal changes in water status, and water storage capacity of tree species are highly correlated. Tree species cluster into a number of distinct functional types ranging from deciduous hardwood trees and water-storing lightwood trees in dry upland forests to evergreen light- and softwood trees confined to moist lowland sites. Seasonal variation in tree water status thus appears to be the principal determinant of both phenology and distribution of tree species in tropical dry forests.",NA,"BORCHERT, R (corresponding author), UNIV KANSAS,DEPT PHYSIOL & CELL BIOL,HAWORTH HALL,LAWRENCE,KS 66045, USA.",542,142,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1994,75,"5",NA,NA,NA,1437,"1449",NA,"10.2307/1937467",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Aerial photograph analyses of beaver activities on the 298-km(2) Kabetogama Peninsula, Minnesota, were coupled with site-specific studies of soil and pore water concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and other ions (potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfate, chloride), nitrogen cycling processes (nitrogen fixation and denitrification), and biophysical environmental variables (vegetation, temperature, organic matter, soil structure, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential). Our analyses demonstrate that beaver influence the distribution, standing stocks, and availability of chemical elements by hydrologically induced alteration of biogeochemical pathways and by shifting element storage from forest vegetation to sediments and soils. Over the 63 yr of aerial photo records (1927-1988), beaver converted 13% of the peninsula to meadows and ponds. Elemental concentrations in soils (in micrograms per cubic centimetre) and in pore water (in milligrams per litre) revealed complex patterns within and among the principal hydrologic zones (e.g., forest, moist meadow, wet meadow, pond, stream). Principal components analysis (PCA) suggested that anaerobic conditions caused by saturation of soil by water was the fundamental control over subsequent alterations of biogeochemical pathways. Although few clear statistical trends were detected for mass- or volume-specific elemental concentrations among habitats, organic horizon (O and A) depths were greatest in the wet meadows and ponds (>15 cm), causing the standing stocks of chemical elements to be greatest there. We argue that the net effect of beaver activities has been to translocate chemical elements from the originally inundated upland forest vegetation to downstream communities and to pond sediments. As the upland vegetation dies and decays after dam construction, only a portion of the chemical elements are exported downstream (except for calcium and magnesium) or returned to the atmosphere (C and N only). Consequently, the organic horizons of pond sediments accumulate substantial standing stocks of chemical elements that are available for vegetative growth when darns fail, the ponds drain, and meadows are formed. Since 1927 beaver activities have augmented the standing stock of chemical elements in the organic horizons by 20-295%, depending on the element. These influences are spatially extensive and long lasting, affecting fundamental environmental characteristics of boreal forest drainage networks for decades to centuries.","CNRS,CTR ECOL RESSOURCES RENOUVELABLES,F-31055 TOULOUSE,FRANCE; UNIV MINNESOTA,CTR WATER & ENVIRONM,DULUTH,MN 55811","NAIMAN, RJ (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR STREAMSIDE STUDIES,AR-10,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",169,133,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1994,75,"4",NA,NA,NA,905,"921",NA,"10.2307/1939415",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

An exclosure experiment simulated preferential grazing and showed that S. alternifora responded negatively while D. spicata responded positively to simulated preferential grazing of S. alterniflora. These results point to a competitive relationship between the grasses under suboptimal conditions for dominance of either species.

By means of observational and experimental approaches, we focused on the possible regulatory effects of parasitoids on the weevil population as well as on the analysis of the sign and strength of the resulting indirect effects on plant fitness. Weevils attacked 21.7% of the fruit produced by H. spinosa during the study, selecting fruits having the most seeds. Seeds eaten by weevils were significantly bigger than uneaten ones. The number of seeds per fruit after being depredated by Ceutorhynchus was significantly smaller than for fruit not attacked. Thus, weevils affect the fitness of the host plant both by decreasing the number of seeds (quantitative effect) and by reducing the average size of surviving seeds per fruit (qualitative effect). When parasitoids were excluded experimentally, the percentage of attacked fruit (which corresponds to the number of weevil larvae) rose from 20 to 43%. We assume that the increase in the experimental weevil population may be because excluding parasitoids eliminates not only death by parasitoid oviposition for some Ceutorhynchus larvae, but also death by direct predation of parasitoids on weevil larvae. We have also experimentally verified that parasitoid activity benefits the entire plant, by way of parasitoids contributing to a higher average number of seeds dispersed per fruit in each plant, by influencing both the abundance of the weevils and the behavior of the weevil larvae.",NA,"GOMEZ, JM (corresponding author), UNIV GRANADA,FAC CIENCIAS,DEPT BIOL ANIM & ECOL,E-18001 GRANADA,SPAIN.",115,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1994,75,"4",NA,NA,NA,1023,"1030",NA,"10.2307/1939426",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In the laboratory, lycaenid larvae reared with ants were 31-76% heavier, developed 37% faster, and commonly completed one or two fewer instars than larvae reared without ants. Ant tending also resulted in 20% heavier pupae, 69% shorter pupal duration, and 5% larger adults as measured by forewing length; adults were not significantly different as measured by body length.

In laboratory experiments, 40% more ant workers survived when lycaenid larvae were present than when they were absent, although ant mass was not significantly affected. We hypothesize that the survivorship effects occurred because ants consumed the lycaenid's nectary gland secretions, which contained considerable amounts of glucose and amino acids.

Ephemeral aquatic habitats provide larval amphibians a transient and highly variable opportunity for growth. In the desert ponds used by Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii), tadpole density varies considerably among ponds and often increases within a pond as it dries. Models of optimal size and timing of metamorphosis predict that, relative to constant high resource environments, metamorphosis should occur at a smaller size in constant low resource environments, and smaller and earlier in declining resource environments, assuming all else is equal. Considerable evidence supports the first prediction, but few studies have examined the effect of decreasing resource availability. I conducted an experiment to examine the effects of increasing density and decreasing food level on metamorphosis in Couch's spadefoot toads. Tadpoles at constant high per capita food metamorphosed at the largest sizes. At low or decreasing per capita food, tadpoles metamorphosed at a uniformly small size, but varied in the time required to reach that size.

In the first context, nonmigratory foraging, predation risk dependent on the bird's body mass leads to risk-averse behavior in situations where risk-neutral behavior would otherwise be expected and generally reduces the amount of foraging and the level of reserves carried by foragers. In the second context, premigratory foraging, mass-dependent predation can lead to risk proneness during the buildup of reserves for migration. Risk proneness is favored if birds can reduce mass and hence reduce predation after migration, thereby giving them an advantage to rapid departure. Other advantages of early departure can also lead to premigratory risk proneness but require more specific ecological assumptions. The literature on risk sensitivity in amount of food reward suggests a connection between migration and risk proneness on negative energy budgets but more tests are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT ZOOL, NERC, BEHAV ECOL UNIT, OXFORD OX1 3PS, ENGLAND",NA,65,13,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1994,75,"4",NA,NA,NA,1131,"1140",NA,"10.2307/1939436",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In this paper we examined the interspecific relationship between the size of seeds and plants and the mean long-term annual seed production per tree. For canopy trees, we show that seed production is highly (inversely) correlated with the mean seed mass as a power law argument. Tree size (basal area or leaf mass) is directly proportional to seed production over a limited range. Analysis of seed production for herbaceous plants indicates a relationship similar to that for trees. As the exponent relating seed size to seed production is > -1.0, it follows that large-seeded plants produce more total annual crop mass than do small-seeded species. However, this is balanced by the greater investment in ancillary reproductive tissue by smaller seeded species.

The PLS data on 127 653 trees at 48 831 sample locations, collected between 1822 and 1854 and tabulated from original field notes, are summarized here to examine the abundance and distribution of major tree species and plant associations. These results are compared to another early, quantified estimate of vegetation published in 1914. These two records of vegetation were compared within 20 vegetation zones in northern Florida. Both data sets describe the vegetation of northern Florida as strongly dominated by pine and similarly describe regions more heavily represented by upland hardwood or forested wetland trees. The data sets differ predominantly in that the PLS data indicate: (1) more pine; (2) less cypress, gum, and sweetgum than the early 20th-century survey; and (3) that, in contrast to major upland hardwood taxa, the representation of major taxa typical of pinelands and forested wetlands is only loosely correlated between data sets. The PLS records were used to map the distribution of species and community types across northern Florida. The PLS data support, and quantify, previously published accounts of the over whelming dominance of pine in the presettlement vegetation of northern Florida.

Because many ecological experiments involve random as well as fixed effects, the most appropriate analysis of variance model to use is often the mixed model. Consideration of effects in an analysis of variance as fixed or random is critical if correct tests are to be made and if correct inferences are to be drawn from these tests. A literature review was conducted to determine whether authors are generally aware of the differences between fixed and random effects and whether they are performing analyses consistent with their consideration. All articles (excluding Notes and Comments) in Ecology and Evolution for the years 1990 and 1991 were reviewed. In general, authors that stated that their model contained both fixed and random effects correctly analyzed it as a mixed model. There were two cases, however, where authors attempted to define fixed effects as random in order to justify broader generalizations about the effects. Most commonly (63% of articles using two-way or greater ANOVA), authors neglected to mention whether they were dealing with a completely fixed, random, or mixed model. In such instances, it was not clear if the author was aware of the distinction between fixed and random effects, and it was often difficult to ascertain from the article whether their analysis was consistent with their experimental methods. These findings suggest several statistical guidelines that should be followed. In particular, the inclusion of explicit consideration of effects as fixed or random and clear descriptions of F tests of interest would provide the reader with confidence that the author has performed the analysis correctly. In addition, such an explicit statement would clarify the limits of the inferences about significant effects.","W VIRGINIA UNIV, DEPT STAT, MORGANTOWN, WV 26506 USA","BENNINGTON, CC (corresponding author), W VIRGINIA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, MORGANTOWN, WV 26506 USA.",191,49,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1994,75,"3",NA,NA,NA,717,"722",NA,"10.2307/1941729",6,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We investigated these effects on the Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis) on snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) growing in high and low-density monocultures and intercropped with short (0.5 m) or tall (1.2 m) com plants (Zea mays). Beetle populations consistently reached higher densities on beans in monocultures than on beans intercropped with tall com. Neither bean plant density nor plant species diversity alone significantly affected beetle abundance. Instead, the presence of tall com plants contributed most to lower bean beetle density in the tall corn-bean intercrop, primarily by reducing adult colonization. However, the tall com also increased the suitability of intercropped bean plants to the beetles because adults preferred to feed on and larvae developed faster on beans in the tall com-bean habitat. Host plant effects were independent of the influence of microclimate and risk of predation. Abundance of natural enemies of the bean beetle was low, and overall, predator density and bean beetle larval survival did not differ significantly among habitats. However, it is difficult to predict the effect of mortality factors, such as natural enemies, on bean beetle populations because larval mortality over time was affected by habitat type (i.e., there was a significant interaction between habitat type and time). Our results were partially consistent with the resource concentration hypothesis. Whereas Mexican bean beetles colonized bean monocultures more readily than they did tall corn-bean diculture, the presence of more suitable host plants in the diculture acted to increase, rather than decrease, bean beetle density in the tall com-bean habitat. However, higher adult feeding preference and faster larval development on beans in the tall corn-bean habitat did not offset lower adult colonization in this habitat.","UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT ENTOMOL,COLL PK,MD 20742",NA,69,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1994,75,"3",NA,NA,NA,723,"731",NA,"10.2307/1941730",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Abdomens of butterflies reared on four asclepiad food plants differed significantly in cardenolide content and palatability to a generalist avian predator (Red-winged Blackbird). However, unpalatability did not directly parallel food plant or butterfly cardenolide content. Queens reared on Sarcostemma clausum were cardenolide free and essentially palatable (85% eaten). Butterflies reared on Asclepias tuberosa and A. incarnata were also virtually cardenolide free, but were weakly and moderately unpalatable, respectively (62 and 46% eaten). Queens reared on the high-cardenolide Asclepias curassavica contained 101-753 mug cardenolide and were very unpalatable (8% eaten). These results suggest that in addition to cardenolides, other asclepiad phytochemicals are directly or indirectly utilized by queens as components of their systemic chemical defense. The demonstrated variation in queen palatability is predicted to affect the aversive conditioning of predators and thus the outcome of queen-predator encounters. Queen populations feeding on more than one asclepiad species must exhibit automimicry, with attack rates on individual butterflies dependent upon both the proportion of palatable automimics and the noxiousness of unpalatable automodels in the population. The verification of a queen palatability spectrum also contributes to understanding the dynamics of mimicry between queens and viceroy butterflies (Limenitis archippus). This study predicts that, as a consequence of regional differences in asclepiad floras, the viceroy-queen mimicry relationship in Florida switches between the Batesian and Mullerian mimicry modes. In the extreme, queens feeding on certain food plants may be Batesian mimics of sympatric, moderately unpalatable viceroys, reversing the traditionally cited mimicry roles of these butterflies.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT ENTOMOL,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611",NA,28,36,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1994,75,"3",NA,NA,NA,732,"746",NA,"10.2307/1941731",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Parameter values that are difficult to estimate independently are obtained by fitting the model to patterns of patch occupancy and local density. There is no large ''mainland'' population, and the metapopulation appears to survive at an extinction-colonization equilibrium. Empty patches were smaller than the occupied ones, indicating the extinction proneness of especially small local populations; population turnover was 16% between 2 yr. Density in the occupied patches increased with decreasing isolation and with decreasing patch area, suggesting that migration plays an important role in local dynamics. Mark-recapture results confirmed that migration between local populations was common, in contrast to what is frequently assumed for butterflies with well-defined local populations in discrete habitat patches. The modelling results demonstrate that it is possible to have empty habitat patches in a metapopulation in spite of frequent migration, as we observed for M. cinxia. Colonization rate of empty patches may be low for several reasons, including difficulties in mate location at low density (not likely to be important here), conspecific attraction (possibly important), stepping-stone and other forms of nonrandom migration (likely to be important), and weak density dependence (likely to be important).

We conducted st field and laboratory study to investigate the ecological and adaptive significance of this physiological phenomenon. Spatial horizontal environmental heterogeneity was observed within clonal populations of H. verticillata in Florida, USA. Measured at midday, the edge habitat at the expanding periphery of the clone exhibited a dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration of 0.7 mmol/L, pH 7.1, a dissolved oxygen (DO) level of 0.13 mmol/L, and biomass of 0.2 kg/m(2). The mat habitat, located 200 cm towards the interior of the surface mat, exhibited DIC 0.1 mmol/L, pH 10.2, DO 0.48 mmol/L, and biomass 0.8 kg/m(2). DIC depletion and DO supersaturation characterized the mat habitat for most of the day and much of the growing season. Furthermore, net photosynthesis, daily carbon gain, and relative growth rate (RGR) of H. verticillata were reduced 80% by mat conditions compared to edge conditions. rs of H. verticillata were positively correlated with CO2 and bicarbonate concentration, and negatively correlated with pH, DO, and biomass. Low and high Gamma photosynthetic phenotypes were associated with the mat and edge habitats, respectively. Photosynthetic phenotype of H. verticillata appears to acclimate to environmental heterogeneity within a clone in the field. Net photosynthesis and dairy carbon gain of low Gamma phenotype H. verticillata was 128% and 40% greater than the high Gamma phenotype when measured in the mat habitat, but was 21% lower than the high Gamma photosynthetic phenotype when measured in the edge habitat under low quantum flux. Laboratory experiments showed a negative curvilinear relationship between the Gamma of H. verticillata and plant density. The data demonstrate that plasticity in photosynthetic phenotype of H. verticillata is a density-dependent, physiological response that optimizes carbon gain within a stressful heterogeneous environment. Evolution of facultative C-4-like photosynthetic metabolism in H. verticillata may have been an adaptation to the contraints imposed upon carbon gain by DIC and quantum flux limitation in the mat habitat.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109; UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT BIOL,TUSCALOOSA,AL 35487",NA,42,12,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1994,75,"2",NA,NA,NA,301,"314",NA,"10.2307/1939536",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The number of species per study site varied between two and six. Stylidium species are pollinated by a variety of nectar-seeking solitary bees and bombyliid flies. Within and among species there is significant variation in nectar-tube length (and therefore in the insects that visit the flowers) and in pollen placement on pollinators. Pollen is placed ''explosively'' on the insect by a motile column of fused staminate and pistillate tissues; the position and reach of the column varies within and among species, thereby causing variation in site of pollen deposition. When discrete pollination niches were defined for all species, only one niche overlap was observed across the 86 interacting pairs of Stylidium species at the 25 sites. To determine whether this was a nonrandom assemblage structure we compared our observation with the outcome of null models. We developed three null models to cover the most likely structuring processes: that communities are organized by (1) ecological sorting, (2) evolution of plant phenotypes, or (3) both processes. We concluded that it was unlikely (P = .055-.002) that so few overlaps in pollination niches would occur by chance. We developed another null model to test whether chance could have created the apparent pattern of character displacement in pollination niches exhibited by the nine species showing intraspecific variation.

A new set of experimental manipulations begun in 1988 at the same site repeated this study. As reported previously for this community, exclusion of three species of Dipodomys from both original and new experimental plots resulted in greater abundances of five species of small granivorous rodents (Chaetodipus penicillatus, Perognathus flavus, Peromyscus ersmicus, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis) on these plots relative to controls. In contrast, there were no significant treatment effects on the abundances of insectivorous grasshopper mice (Onychomys spp.). The long time lag before the response by small granivores to Dipodomys removal observed in the original experiment was not repeated in the experiment begun in 1988. Long-term (10 yr) exclusion of kangaroo rats from experimental plots has resulted in changes in vegetative cover, particularly increased grassiness, on these plots relative to controls. We used the repetition of the Dipodomys exclusion experiment in 1988 to evaluate the importance of this potential indirect effect of kangaroo rats on other rodents in this community. By examining differences in rodent capture numbers on the original and new sets of Dipodomys exclusion plots, we could identify four species (C. penicillatus, Perognathus flavus, Peromyscus eremicus, P. maniculatus) whose responses to kangaroo rat removal reflected direct competition from kangaroo rats, one species (R. megalotis) whose response reflected both direct and indirect (via vegetation changes and habitat selection) effects, and two species (Sigmodon hispidus, S. fulviventer) whose responses reflected only vegetation-mediated effects. The continuous presence of competition between small granivores and kangaroo rats over the 13-yr study despite large, species-specific fluctuations in abundances suggests that competition is pervasive within this community.","UNIV NEW MEXICO,DEPT BIOL,ALBUQUERQUE,NM 87131",NA,145,64,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1994,75,"2",NA,NA,NA,438,"445",NA,"10.2307/1939547",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

These models assume that individuals within a population are distributed in space and that important interactions among individuals take place over some predefined local scale. Local density dependence in the model produces dynamics that depend on the scale of the dispersal distance. When dispersal occurs over long distances, the population enters a stable limit cycle. However, when colonization is limited to the same local neighborhood where competition is taking place, the spatial and temporal patterns become chaotic. Habitat size also affects the dynamics. Chaotic dynamics become cyclical as habitat size decreased. These results illustrate how a wide array of complex dynamics can arise with simple spatially distributed models and that the resulting dynamics can depend on the habitat size.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT BOT,DURHAM,NC 27706",NA,104,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1994,75,"1",NA,NA,NA,30,"39",NA,"10.2307/1939379",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We develop a series of simulations, based on standard metapopulation and partial differential equation models, that explicitly track variability among individuals or locations, and compare the results with what would be obtained by ignoring such variability. We find, first, that variability among patches can have a strong influence on the outcome of community dynamics, by promoting the coexistence of species that would otherwise exclude one or the other through competition. Second, variability among individuals in their rates of movement can markedly increase the rate of spread of a population. Construction and analysis of a modified PDE (partial differential equation) model for a population that consists of two classes of individuals, dispersers and nondispersers, confirms the second result, and also shows that the presence of even a few rapidly dispersing individuals can markedly increase the rate of spread of the population. Our simulations and analysis show that the incorporation of variability into ecological thinking is feasible and that it can strengthen our ability to investigate the effects of spatial processes.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT APPL MATH,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,CTR QUANTITAT SCI,SEATTLE,WA 98195","GOLDWASSER, L (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,INST MARINE SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106, USA.",53,18,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1994,75,"1",NA,NA,NA,40,"47",NA,"10.2307/1939380",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among other unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and Mytilus abundance because of space competition; (c) Mytilus reduces Semibalanus cover through competition for space; and (d) as prey species, Semibalanus and Pollicipes enhance Nucella density, but Nucella predation does not have important effects on Semibalanus or Pollicipes. Based on the estimated strength of direct interactions, the importance of indirect effects among species could also be predicted. In experiments manipulating Nucella, Pollicipes, Semibalanus, and birds independently of one another, I tested 11 of the interactions predicted by the path analysis; all were supported. Path analysis in conjunction with limited experiments may provide an efficient means to predict important direct and indirect interactions among unmanipulated species within ecological communities.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL NJ15,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",NA,342,115,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1994,75,"1",NA,NA,NA,151,"165",NA,"10.2307/1939391",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Its involvement is further supported by several studies, which have provided evidence that survival, incidence of disease, and selected gross measures of immunity change temporally with density and season. We examined this hypothesis by documenting the existence of temporal alterations in selected measures of both humoral and cell-mediated immune function in a population of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), a species known to fluctuate widely in density, inhabiting a tallgrass prairie in central Oklahoma. A total of 310 cotton rats was collected from August 1989 to May 1991 (10 collections) using conventional live-trap methods. In addition to morphological characteristics of primary and secondary lymphoid organs, the ability of splenocytes to produce specific antibody in response to a single injection of sheep erythrocytes and to proliferate in response to in vitro exposure to mitogens was measured to assess immunocompetence. Whole blood was collected for the determination of total peripheral blood leukocyte counts, packed cell volume, and total serum proteins. Statistically significant differences in all variables except total serum protein existed among the 10 collections and most of this variability was independent of specific seasonal time periods.

I used Pseudacris crucifer tadpoles to test two models for predicting tadpole age and size at metamorphosis under changing environmental conditions. The Wilbur-Collins model states that metamorphosis is initiated as a function of a tadpole's size and relative growth rate, and predicts that changes in growth rate throughout the larval period affect age and size at metamorphosis. An alternative model, the fixed-rate model, states that age at metamorphosis is fixed early in larval life, and subsequent changes in growth rate will have no effect on the length of the larval period. My results confirm that food supplies affect both age and size at metamorphosis, but developmental rates became fixed at approximately Gosner (1960) stages 3 5-37. Neither model completely predicted these results. I suggest that the generally accepted Wilbur-Collins model is improved by incorporating a point of fixed developmental timing. Growth trajectories predicted from this modified model fit the results of this study better than trajectories based on either of the original models.

I observed snail movements by conducting daily censuses of the reefs and constructed transition matrices describing the movements of snails in each treatment among the three species of coral.

Snails preferred to occupy Briareum asbestinum over Plexaurella dichotoma or Pseudopterogorgia acerosa, but these preferences were strongly influenced by previous experience. Moreover, females tended to move from B. asbestinum to Plexaurella dichotoma to oviposit, and back to B. asbestinum afterwards.

The relative contribution of genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic variation is rarely determined, especially for vertebrates. However, distinguishing between phenotypic plasticity induced by proximate environmental variation and genetic divergence is fundamental to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of geographic variation. We used a reciprocal transplant experiment to uncover the relative importance of population-specific (genetic) and environmental sources of variation in individual growth rates between two populations of the fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. Our study revealed a population x environment interaction, consistent with a genotype x environment interaction that would result if differences between populations were genetically based. The growth rates of Nebraska lizards, normally twice that of New Jersey lizards, were reduced by half when the animals were transplanted to New Jersey. However, New Jersey lizards showed no increase in growth rates when transplanted to Nebraska. Comparisons of relative food availability (arthropod abundance) indicated that more food was available in New Jersey during the experiment. Estimates of potential activity day length using hollow copper models were from 2 to 2.5 h longer in Nebraska. This result suggests that the thermal biophysical environment may have reduced growth rates of Nebraska lizards transplanted to New Jersey, perhaps by reducing foraging time or by limiting physiological processes supporting growth. Our results are consistent with previous studies of S. undulatus that assumed genetic differences in life histories between populations and implicated the thermal biophysical environment as an ecological source of variation.","UNIV PENN,DEPT BIOL,LEIDY LABS,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104",NA,157,34,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1993,74,"7",NA,NA,NA,1992,"2002",NA,"10.2307/1940842",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

That is, those species that exploit food with low energy content and/or high cost of digestion tend to have low, mass-independent metabolic rates. To date there is not an experimental test of this pattern. The aim of this work was to examine experimentally the effect of diet quality on BMR, digestive efficiency, and the relationship between digestion and energy expenditure in a small herbivorous mammal. We used as a model the herbivorous caviomorph burrowing rodent Octodon degus (m(b) nearly 200 g), an inhabitant of semi-arid and mediterranean communities of nor-them and central Chile. Individuals maintained during 27 wk with a diet high in dietary fiber showed significantly lower BMRs (28%) than those feeding on low fiber. Daily food intake and ingestion rates (energy and dry matter) of individuals under a high-fiber diet were significantly higher than animals maintained with a low-fiber diet. The same pattern was obtained for total feces production and rate of feces production. The total intake and rate of ingestion of proteins were not significantly different between treatments. However, a significantly higher amount of protein was excreted by the individuals exposed to a high-fiber diet. Apparent digestibility of dry matter, energy, and protein were consistently lower in individuals maintained with high fiber. However, nonsignificant differences were observed between gut contents in the two treatments (P > .58), but a significantly higher digesta turnover rate was observed in animals exposed to a high-fiber diet (P < .05). A significant correlation was found between digestibility and the basal metabolic rate of individuals (r(s) = 0.781, P < .01), suggesting that elevated digestibilities on high-quality diets allow increased basal rates of metabolism. We suggest that, although small mammals like degus may select sparsely distributed plants of high quality in their habitat, their capability to drop their metabolic demands may help them meet their nutritional and energy requirements when nutritional conditions in the environment deteriorate.","UNIV CHILE, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT CIENCIAS ECOL, CASILLA 653, SANTIAGO, CHILE",NA,114,27,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1993,74,"7",NA,NA,NA,2003,"2010",NA,"10.2307/1940843",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Therefore competition experiments need to examine how different species change resource availability to their neighbors, and how different species respond to these changes-allocationally, architecturally, and physiologically-through time. In a greenhouse study we used a model system of annuals to examine how canopies of species having differing morphologies differed in their architectures and light-interception abilities, and how different species performed when grown in these canopies. Abutilon theophrasti, Datura stramonium, and Polygonum pensylvanicum were grown as ''targets,'' surrounded by neighbors of a single species. Neighbors could be any one of the target species or Setaria faberii. Plants were grown in pots, with one target plant and four neighbor plants. Detailed measurements of neighbor canopy structure and target plant canopy architecture were made at five harvests. Species with different morphologies showed large differences in canopy structure, particularly when grass and forb species were compared. Setaria, a grass, had a more open canopy than the other species (all forbs), and was a consistently weak competitor. Overall, however, the relative effects of different neighbors on target biomass varied with target species. Target biomass was poorly correlated with neighbor biomass and leaf area, but was highly correlated with a measure of target light-interception ability that took into account both target leaf deployment and neighbor light interception. Despite clear differences among neighbor species in canopy structure and effect on light penetration, the results suggest no broad generalizations about the effects of different species as neighbors.

(Asteraceae), a clonal pseudoannual that is an herbaceous ramet for one season, but propagates as a perennial through tubers that quickly dissociate from the parent plant. H. tuberosus ramets grown from tubers allocated 24% of their end-of-season biomass to tubers and 9% to sexual organs, with substantial variation attributable to four genetic lines cultured from eastern Iowa. Experimentally induced failure of sexual reproduction increased allocation to asexual reproduction under common garden conditions. Plants with inflorescence buds removed produced more (82 vs. 69) and larger (4.4 g vs. 3.8 g) tubers than those with unlimited sexual reproduction. Total biomass allocation to reproduction in plants receiving the bud-removal treatment was equivalent to combined allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction in plants that produced flower heads and achenes. This suggests a complete diversion of resources from sexual to asexual reproduction when sexual reproduction is thwarted. Aboveground plant size did not change with treatment. These results suggest a flexible life history that can respond to sexual failure resulting from low pollinator availability or damage to inflorescences from herbivory or weather, with enhanced facultative production of asexual tubers capable of sexual reproduction the following year.

We discuss two less commonly used regression analyses that could find wide application in ecology, logistic regression and LOWESS regression. Logistic regression is appropriate in cases where the dependent variable is categorical, dichotomous, or polychotomous. It can be used with continuous and/or discrete independent variables. Logistic regression is motivated by the underlying binomial or multinomial distribution of dichotomous and polychotomous dependent variables and transforms the data to explicitly model these distributions. Locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing or LOWESS regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable when no single functional form will do. LOWESS regression is motivated by the assumption that neighboring values of the independent variable are the best indicators of the dependent variable in that range of independent values.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI B-142,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306","TREXLER, JC (corresponding author), FLORIDA INT UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,MIAMI,FL 33199, USA.",432,42,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","SEP",1993,74,"6",NA,NA,NA,1629,"1637",NA,"10.2307/1939921",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

There are no recipes for doing so and judgment must be exercised every time; the experimenter's knowledge about the experimental material, combined with premanipulation or control, then, provides a useful prerequisite.

Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models.

But many problems of biological interest concern the extremes in a variable (e.g., highest temperature, largest force, longest drought, maximum lifespan) rather than its central tendency. Such extremes are not adequately addressed by standard biostatistics. In these cases an alternative approach-the statistics of extremes-can be of value. In the limit of a large number of measurements, the probability structure of extreme values conforms to a generalized distribution described by three parameters. In practice these parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Using this estimate of the probability distribution of extreme values, one can predict the expected time between the imposition of extremes of a given magnitude (a return time) and can place confidence limits on this prediction. Using data regarding sea-surface temperature, wave-induced hydrodynamic forces, wind speeds, and human life-spans we show that accurate long-term predictions can al times be made from a surprisingly small number of measurements if appropriate care is taken in the application of the statistics. For example, accurate long-term prediction of sea-surface temperatures can be derived from short-term data that are anomalous in that they contain the effects of an extreme El Nino. In the cases of wave-induced forces and wind speeds, the probability distribution of extreme values is similar among years and diverse sites, indicating the possible existence of underlying unifying principles governing these phenomena.

Sites were selected over a wide variety of soil types and related vegetation associations, but within a single regional climate. The deltaC-13 of the bulk leaf material falling on the soil varied among sites, ranging from -29.5 to -26 parts per thousand. Within this range, differences up to 1.5 parts per thousand were attributable to differences in tree species. Further differences were related to site. The deltaC-13 values of soil organic matter cover the range -29.8 to -24.3 parts per thousand and varied with both parent vegetation deltaC-13 and depth. Transformation and decay of organic C within the litter layers led to no isotope enrichment, irrespective of vegetation and humus type: mull, hydromull, moder, or anmoor. The difference between woody and leaf material in litter was low, 0.23 +/- 0.35 parts per thousand (mean +/- 1 SD). On the other hand deltaC-13 in mineral horizons always increased with depth, reaching values richer than litter by 1.0 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand at 20 cm and up to + 1.5 parts per thousand at 1 m. The trend was independent of the soil physico-chemical characteristics, whether aerobic, anaerobic, eutrophic, oligotrophic, or podzolic. Isotope ratios of soil organic C in forests appear to provide useful estimators of tree isotopic composition. When compared to the measurements of the vegetation, they offer the advantage of an easily obtained value that naturally integrates over plant material, time and, eventually, local area.","INRA, SCI SOL STN, F-78026 VERSAILLES, FRANCE","BALESDENT, J (corresponding author), UNIV PARIS 06, INRA, BIOGEOCHIM ISOTOP LAB, CASE 120, 4 PL JUSSIE, F-75252 PARIS 10, FRANCE.",293,98,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1993,74,"6",NA,NA,NA,1713,"1721",NA,"10.2307/1939930",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

These paradigms are derived from studies of a small number of species whose life history traits place them easily into ''pioneer'' or ''climax'' species. Woody plants of the forest understory, subcanopy trees and shrubs, are known to affect significantly regeneration dynamics in treefall gaps, yet we lack fundamental information on life history characteristics of understory plants that could permit their incorporation into gap regeneration models. We investigated intra- and interspecific variability in early life history characteristics of understory Melastomataceae species of different growth forms and adult distributions from the lowland tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We examined germination patterns in vitro (22 species), effects on germination of passage through birds (5 species), seedling establishment in the field (3 species), and growth in different light environments (8 species). Established seedlings were significantly more abundant in gaps than in nearby understory sites. This pattern was generally applicable to all melastomes studied, regardless of the habitat where adults were normally most abundant. Seedlings were more common in the root pits and on the root mounds of uprooted trees, even though there was less light available to the seedlings in these microsites than elsewhere in the gaps. In a series of germination trials in vitro, most seeds germinated readily within 1-2 wk. Comparisons of germination rates between seeds collected from bird droppings and seeds extracted from fruits by hand gave varied results. With one exception, seeds of shade-tolerant species germinated more slowly following passage through birds, while seeds from high-light-demanding species germinated more rapidly after passing through birds. Seeds of three common species were sown directly into different microsites within gaps and understory control sites. In contrast to the germination trials, emergence percentages in the field ranged from 4% in understory sites to 21% in gap centers. Survival after 1 yr was low (0.1%-0.4%). After 1 yr, these seedlings were small (< 2 cm tall) and produced few leaves. In similar light environments in the shade-house, melastome seedling survival was between 80% and 100%, and growth increased with increasing light levels from 2% (corresponding to understory sites) to 20% (small gap centers) of full sun. With the exception of two species common to abandoned pastures and river banks, the species used in the shade-house growth experiments did not show significant increases in growth with increases in light from 20% to 40%.

We experimentally tested both hypotheses to explain changes in phlorotannin concentrations in the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus. Fucus was collected monthly from two estuarine sites (Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA) differing in nitrogen availability, and analyzed for polyphenolic levels and tissue-nitrogen concentrations. In situ nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted to measure changes in polyphenolic levels related to N availability. Simulated grazing experiments examined the possibility of induced increases in polyphenolic concentrations in Fucus vesiculosus. Paired choice experiments conducted in the laboratory examined feeding selectivity by the snail Littorina littorea for either Fucus population. Field measurements and experiments revealed temporal and site-related changes in tissue constituents. Polyphenolic concentrations were consistently, sometimes two times, higher in Fucus vesiculosus from the low-N site compared with algae from the high-N site; tissue-N content was higher in the population from the high-N site. For both populations, tissue N was inversely correlated with polyphenolic concentrations. Only Fucus from the low-N site showed a significant reduction in polyphenolic concentrations under experimental enrichment. Regression analysis revealed a significant inverse relationship (R2 = 0.71) between phenolic concentrations and growth rates for Fucus at the high-N, but not the low-N site. This suggests a growth cost associated with phlorotannin production for this phenolic-poor population due, perhaps, to C-limited growth. Phlorotannin concentrations increased significantly in clipped Fucus at the low-N site in two of three simulated grazing experiments, indicating an inducible response. We did not find a significant inducible response for the high-N, phenolic-poor population, and our choice experiments revealed a clear preference for this population by Littorina littorea. Our results offer support for both the induced-defense and carbon/nutrient balance hypotheses as explanation for variations in phlorotannin concentrations in Fucus vesiculosus. We suggest that within-species variation in polyphenolics is due to a complex interaction of environmental (nutrient availability, irradiance levels) and defense-related (grazing activity) factors.","SMITH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, NORTHAMPTON, MA 01063 USA",NA,189,49,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1993,74,"6",NA,NA,NA,1757,"1766",NA,"10.2307/1939934",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Caraco and Gillespie built a risk-sensitive foraging model to explain this paradox. Their model demonstrates that it may be advantageous to relocate more often when experiencing high prey capture rates (under certain regimes of spatiotemporal heterogeneity). However, their model had not been tested. I tested the Caraco-Gillespie model by conducting food addition experiments in the field with spiders in the poor habitat. The results do not support the model. A reexamination of the Caraco-Gillespie model suggests that it implicitly assumes unlikely larger scale patterns in prey availability. I present an alternative hypothesis to explain the paradox. Since conspecific density is higher in rich habitats, I propose that more intense conspecific interactions in rich habitats cause these spiders to move to new web sites more often. I conducted three replicates of a density reduction experiment in a rich habitat, and the results support the conspecific density hypothesis. The results of these experiments challenge a widely cited example of risk-sensitive foraging, and underline the importance of explicitly considering multiple scales of variation in ecology.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA; UNIV ARIZONA, CTR INSECT STUDIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",NA,43,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1993,74,"6",NA,NA,NA,1826,"1835",NA,"10.2307/1939940",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This study tests three hypotheses proposed to explain this relationship, using 21 species of dasyurids (body mass range: 5-200 g) throughout continental Australia: (1) the maximum prey size that can be physically handled increases with dasyurid size due to the restricted gapes or forces of biting of smaller dasyurids; (2) the prey size that maximizes rate of energy intake varies with dasyurid size, with animals preferentially consuming the most profitable prey; and (3) prey sizes encountered during foraging vary with dasyurid size. Field observations of dasyurids were made at 20 study areas between January 1980 and February 1991. Most dasyurids were live-trapped, weighed, and sexed before being released at the trap site. We then tracked each animal and sampled potential prey in their foraging microhabitats. Dasyurid diets were examined using scat analysis. We measured rate of energy intake for captive dasyurids by offering different-sized cockroaches, measuring processing times, and calculating the energy content of cockroaches used. The first hypothesis was rejected. Both large and small dasyurids could grasp and pierce the largest prey offered in the laboratory, which were similar in size to the largest prey potentially available in the field. The second and third hypotheses were supported. Individuals of the smaller species maximized rates of energy gain in captivity by feeding preferentially on small prey, and their foraging trails in the field traversed microhabitats where mean potential prey size encountered was small (2-4 mm long). In contrast, larger dasyurids preferred large prey, obtained a greater rate of energy gain from them, and foraged in microhabitats where prey lengths averaged greater-than-or-equal-to 6 mm. There was a tendency for larger dasyurids to include progressively larger prey in their diets than were available, on average, along their foraging trails. This may reflect increasing selectivity for larger prey. However, it may also reflect a reduced susceptibility to predation or increased competitive ability for large dasyurids in productive microhabitats, and hence reflect a size-based advantage in encountering large prey. These results indicate that net energy yield and the use of microhabitats with different prey sizes are the most important determinants of the body size-prey size relationship in dasyurid marsupials.","UNIV SYDNEY, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA",NA,70,30,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SEP",1993,74,"6",NA,NA,NA,1871,"1883",NA,"10.2307/1939944",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

This paper explores the use of a global theory called ''permanence'' that indicates whether the boundary of a phase space is a repellor to orbits in the phase space. The theory is used to try to identify, at a qualitative level, the states to which solutions tend in the phase space of an arbitrary pool of species. We define a ''permanent state'' of the pool as a subset of the species that is permanent in its own right and uninvadable by any other species from the pool. A simple assembly rule for communities that stems from this is that no permanent state can be a subset of another. Data on coexistence of drosophilid species and also on that of cuckoo-doves, although incomplete, are consistent with this rule. A method is given for finding the permanent states of pools of species with Lotka-Volterra dynamics. Some properties of permanent states are illustrated by means of numerical examples from regional pools of species generated with Lotka-Volterra dynamics. These examples show three kinds of dynamics: a single permanent state, two or more alternative permanent states in which none are subsets of others, and an absence of any permanent states. The statistical distribution of these outcomes in pools of four and five species indicates that a single permanent state is the most likely one to occur, but that alternative states become more probable as the number of interactions among species increases. The implications of these results for understanding and modelling the process of succession driven by population dynamics are discussed.","UNIV YORK, YORK YO1 5DD, N YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",NA,148,56,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1993,74,"5",NA,NA,NA,1347,"1361",NA,"10.2307/1940065",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Passive dispersal can cause chaotic dynamics to be replaced by simple periodic dynamics. Thus passive movement can be stabilizing, even in a deterministic model without underlying spatial variation in the dynamics. The boundary between initial conditions leading to qualitatively different dynamics can be a fractal, so it is essentially impossible to specify the asymptotic behavior in terms of the initial conditions.

Effects of meiofauna and protist density manipulations on bacterial 'numbers and division rates and microalgal biomass were determined over 6 d each month. Results varied among experiments, microbial groups, and vertical positions within the sediment. Meiofaunal effects increased bacterial division rates but not densities in January subsurface and March surface sediments. In June, enhanced meiofaunal densities decreased subsurface but increased surface bacterial densities. A complex, tri-trophic-level interaction among meiofauna, protists, and bacteria probably caused the increased bacterial densities in June surface sediments. Meiofauna had no discernible effect on bacterial densities and division rates in January surface and March subsurface sediments even though relatively small (< 50%) differences between treatments could be detected with reasonable statistical power. Changes in microalgal biomass could not be attributed to experimental treatments, and meiofauna likely have a limited effect on microalgae in this intertidal seagrass habitat. Results indicate that the combined effects of meiofauna can alter microbial densities and growth rates and significantly affect microbenthic community structure. Spatial and temporal variability in the nature of trophic interactions will determine the cumulative effects of meiofauna on microbial communities.","CSIRO, MARINE LABS, CLEVELAND, QLD 4163, AUSTRALIA",NA,20,13,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUL",1993,74,"5",NA,NA,NA,1475,"1489",NA,"10.2307/1940076",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We used aerial photographs to measure transition rates as evidence for mosaic shifts among grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland communities in central coastal California between 1947 and 1989. In unburned plots without livestock, transition from grassland to coastal sage scrub was 0.69% per year, coastal sage scrub to oak woodland was 0.30% per year, and oak woodland to grassland was 0.08% per year. These transition rates, considered together, indicate that vegetation patterns may be dynamic on landscapes dominated by these communities. In burned plots without livestock, and in unburned plots where livestock were not excluded, transition rates were lower, except for the conversion of oak woodland to grassland. In burned plots, a high rate of transition of coastal sage scrub to grassland was measured. Markov chain models predicted much less directional change in community proportions in either grazed or burned conditions than in ungrazed, unburned conditions. Some transition rates varied with substrate and topographical position, indicating that fire, grazing, and the physical environment interacted to determine direction and rate of vegetation change. Variation in transition on different substrates suggests that only portions of the vegetation of these landscapes may be dynamic, with some patches in certain combinations of environment and disturbance that change rapidly, and other patches that remain static as edaphic or topographic climax communities.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT GEOG,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106",NA,132,70,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUL",1993,74,"5",NA,NA,NA,1567,"1578",NA,"10.2307/1940084",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Still, ecologists have a poor understanding of how details of the disturbance regime influence the success with which invaders spread through a community. In this paper, we report results from an experiment that investigates how the spatial distribution of bare ground influences the rate at which offspring of an introduced invader spread through a perennial ryegrass community. Artificially created gaps of three sizes were positioned along linear transects according to one of two spatial distributions. These six transects (one for each treatment combination) were positioned as spokes on a wheel and Senecio vulgaris was introduced into the center. After controlling for the total amount of gap area, we monitored the number ard position of Senecio vulgaris establishing for two subsequent generations. Our results showed that the rate of spread of Senecio vulgaris was sensitive to both the gap size and the gap distribution; plants moved a greater distance when the gaps were large and underdispersed. Simulation models confirm that this pattern follows from the way in which gaps sample from seed shadows. We derive an analytical expression to explain why the mean seed dispersal distance does not predict the spread of Senecio vulgaris adults, and show how rates of spatial spread will change under different spatial patterns of disturbance. Finally, a model of spatial point processes confirms that the distribution of gaps mediates the rate of weed spread in two dimensions as well.","UNIV OXFORD, AFRC, DEPT ZOOL, ECOL & BEHAV UNIT, OXFORD OX1 3PS, ENGLAND; UNIV CHICAGO, DEPT STAT, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",NA,113,22,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1993,74,"4",NA,NA,NA,999,"1011",NA,"10.2307/1940470",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Furthermore, voles that dispersed from sibling groups did so sooner than dispersing voles from nonsibling groups. Voles released with nonsiblings were recaptured within the plots for longer periods than were voles from sibling groups. Males from both groups remained within the plots for shorter times than did females, but the degree of this sex bias was greater for sibling groups.

In birds arriving with body masses below almost-equal-to 3.5 g, the initial period of mass gain was very slow. This slow gain was not explained by energy costs associated with territory establishment or learning to secure food, since it occurred even in years when nectar resources were superabundant and territoriality was nearly nonexistent. Data on body composition indicate that mass gain up to almost-equal-to 3.5 g was due to deposition of nonlipid body components, which we hypothesize to be proteins involved in rebuilding muscle catabolized during the last stage of the recent migratory flight. Following the initial phase of slow mass gain, an accelerating rise in body mass consisted entirely of lipid gain. On average, overnight mass loss decreased prior to migration, suggesting that nocturnal torpor facilitated lipid deposition. The slow phase of mass gain is a potentially important constraint on migrating hummingbirds, because if they deplete their fat stores and allow their body mass to fall below 3.5 g, they incur a substantial cost in terms of greatly increased time spent on the subsequent stopover.","OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT RADIAT MED, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA; SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA; HUBBS SEA WORLD RES INST, SAN DIEGO, CA 92109 USA; UNIV ADELAIDE, DEPT ZOOL, ADELAIDE, SA 5001, AUSTRALIA","CARPENTER, FL (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA.",71,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1993,74,"4",NA,NA,NA,1173,"1182",NA,"10.2307/1940487",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In addition to determining the links between predators and prey, we estimate the frequencies of predation (the link strengths), and find an approximately bell-shaped distribution with a majority of links of intermediate frequencies. Some of the properties of this web contrast strongly with those of webs in the ECOWeB compilation. In particular, our analysis shows this web to possess an unusual richness of intermediate species (relative to top predators or basal species) and of links between those intermediate species. The number and lengths of chains are also unusually high, as is the degree of omnivory. Nor does this web match the predictions of the cascade model, which predicts even higher proportions of intermediate species and links between them, and even more numerous chains. It appears that these and other differences are not due simply to the large number of species involved here, but it is not yet clear whether they should be ascribed to the completeness with which some of the diets are known, to differences between the ways this and other webs were constructed, or to unique ecological conditions on the island of St. Martin.","STANFORD UNIV, DEPT BIOL, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA",NA,170,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1993,74,"4",NA,NA,NA,1216,"1233",NA,"10.2307/1940492",18,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Ninety zooplankton communities, varying in biomass and in size distributions, were sampled in 28 lakes in northeastern North America and their grazing rates were predicted with an allometric equation. Zooplankton size distributions vary in shape but, on average, can be described as bimodal.

Community biomass on the other hand increases with mean body size (r2 = 0.39).

Energetic costs were evaluated by quantifying the metabolic expenditure associated with swimming at a given velocity. We estimated benefits by measuring potential energetic gains of feeding at a given velocity. This included estimates of the ability of the fish to capture prey at different current velocities as well as estimates of the frequency and the energy content of drifting prey at various velocities. We derived separate models for small (53-70 mm SL [standard length]) and medium (71-125 mm SL) trout, and medium (47-52 mm SL) and large (53-70 mm SL) dace for all seasons, deriving net energy gain as a function of current velocity. We predicted fishes would occupy velocities at which net energy gain was maximized. Predicted velocities were compared with those utilized by fishes inhabiting Coweeta Creek. Optimal velocities predicted by energetic models ranged from 7.7 to 22.1 cm/s, and closely matched actual velocity use (average deviation = 2.6 cm/s). Prey capture success appeared to be the most important component in the models. Consequently, we constructed models based solely upon aspects of capture success; the average deviation from velocity use with these models was only 1.8 cm/s. Thus, the ability of dace and trout to capture prey at varying velocities appears to be the dominant factor affecting microhabitat selection in these species.","UNIV GEORGIA, SCH FOREST RESOURCES, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA",NA,251,34,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1993,74,"3",NA,NA,NA,685,"698",NA,"10.2307/1940796",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The species make up one of several coexisting pairs that apparently formed in the past 13 000 yr in coastal British Columbia lakes. Previous comparative work has shown that morphology and habitat use are correlated within and among populations. Sticklebacks occurring alone in lakes are intermediate in morphology and habitat use, suggesting that differences between the sympatric species result from ecological character displacement. I tested two hypotheses to explain these patterns, and which are implicit in general views of the causes of adaptive radiation: (1) Each resource (habitat) subjects its species to unique selection pressures, owing to the advantages of certain combinations of traits for foraging; (2) Phenotypes intermediate between habitat specialists suffer a competitive disadvantage. These hypotheses were evaluated by measuring the foraging rates of the two species and their interspecific hybrids in the two main habitats (benthos and open water) provided in the laboratory. Efficiencies of habitat exploitation matched observed morphological differences. In the benthic habitat the larger, deeper bodies species (having also a wide mouth and few short gill rakers) was superior to the smaller, more slender species (having a narrow mouth and many long gill rakers). Success of hybrids was intermediate. This rank order of species efficiencies was reversed in the open water habitat. These results support the hypothesis that different traits are favored in different habitats, and that adaptation to one habitat has occurred at the expense of feeding rate in the other. Average foraging success of hybrids in the two habitats fell near or below the average of the two parental species, suggesting natural selection against intermediate phenotypes. Foraging efficiency in open water was greatest in the smaller size classes of fish, hinting that small size of the open water species is the result of selection for high foraging efficiency.

We tested the following predictions of this view using bird census data from a fragment ''archipelago'' in the southern Finnish taiga: (1) the location of breeding pairs varies randomly among the fragments from year to year, and (2) the pattern of species accrual with increasing sample size is similar to random sampling. The data agreed with the predictions. For most species the distribution of pairs in the fragments agreed with the Poisson prediction. The pattern of species turnover in single fragments agreed with the sampling view so that an average fragment had about 10 pairs of 7 species in a single breeding season, and about 40 pairs of 13 species over the 4-yr period. The sampling model is a ''null'' assumption that should be considered when assessing the occurrence of birds in small habitat fragments. This requirement defines methodological imperatives that have often been violated in ornithological studies; we discuss such methodological problems. The sampling model implies that local turnover in small fragments may be a mechanical reflection of change in territory location from year to year and disconnected from population dynamics.

This research evaluated the effects of enriched CO2 on the productivity and phytochemistry of forest trees and performance of associated insects. Our experimental system consisted of three tree species (quaking aspen [Populus tremuloides], red oak [Quercus rubra], sugar maple [Acer saccharum]) that span a range from fast to slow growing, and two species of leaf-feeding insects (gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar] and forest tent caterpillar [Malacosoma disstria]). Carbon-nutrient balance theory provided a framework for tests of three hypotheses; in response to enriched CO2: (1) relative increases in tree growth rates will be greatest for aspen and least for maple, (2) relative decreases in protein and increases in carbon-based compounds will be greatest for aspen and least for maple, and (3) relative reductions in performance will be greatest for insects fed aspen and least for insects fed maple. We grew 1-yr-old seedlings for 60 d under ambient (385 +/- 5 muL/L) or elevated (642 +/- 2 muL/L) CO2 regimes at the University of Wisconsin Biotron. After 50 d, we conducted feeding trials with penultimate-instar gypsy moth and forest tent caterpillars. After 60 d, a second set of trees was harvested and partitioned into root, stem, and leaf tissues. We subsequently analyzed leaf material for a variety of compounds known to affect performance of insect herbivores. In terms of actual dry-matter production, aspen responded the most to enriched CO2 atmospheres whereas maple responded the least. Proportional growth increases (relative to ambient plants), however, were highest for oak and least for maple. Effects of elevated CO2 on biomass allocation patterns differed among the three species; root-to-shoot ratios increased in aspen, decreased in oak, and did not change in maple. Enriched CO2 altered concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites in leaves, but the magnitude and direction of effects were species-specific. Aspen showed the largest change in storage carbon compounds (starch), whereas maple experienced the largest change in defensive carbon compounds (condensed and hydrolyzable tannins). Consumption rates of insects fed high-CO2 aspen increased dramatically, but growth rates declined. The two species of insects differed in response to oak and maple grown under enriched CO2. Gypsy moths grew better on high-CO2 Oak, whereas forest tent caterpillars were unaffected; tent caterpillars tended to grow less on high-CO2 maple, whereas gypsy moths were unaffected. Changes in insect performance parameters were related to changes in foliar chemistry. Responses of plants and insects agreed with some, but not all, of the predictions of carbon-nutrient balance theory.

We tested a mechanistic model of regulation of intake rate of herbivores foraging in food-concentrated patches (Laca and Demment 1992, Spalinger and Hobbs 1992) that accounts for asymptotic, Type II responses. The model is based on the hypothesis that competition between cropping and chewing regulates instantaneous intake rate in response to changes in the size of bites obtained by the forager. We tested this hypothesis and examined the ability of our model to account for observations of intake rate of 12 species of mammalian herbivores ranging in body mass over 4 orders of magnitude. We measured short-term intake rates of mammalian herbivores feeding in hand-assembled patches of plants. We varied bite size by changing plant height and density in patches offered to herbivores, and observed dry matter intake rates in response to this variation. Averaged across species, our model accounted for 77% of the variance in food intake rate (P < .001 for all species). Predictions of maximum intake rate closely resembled observations of processing capacity, demonstrating that processing rather than cropping sets an upper limit on short-term intake. Tests of model mechanisms provided strong support for the hypothesis that competition between cropping and chewing is responsible for the Type II functional response seen in herbivores feeding in food-concentrated patches. The model was able to consistently predict intake rates observed in 16 previous studies. These results indicate that plant characteristics regulating bite size (e.g., leaf size and geometry, spinescence) frequently control instantaneous rates of food intake by mammalian herbivores.","TEXAS A&M UNIV SYST, TEXAS AGR EXPT STN, UVALDE, TX 78801 USA; COLORADO DIV WILDLIFE, MAMMALS RES SECT, FT COLLINS, CO 80526 USA; COLORADO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA","GROSS, JE (corresponding author), COLORADO STATE UNIV, NAT RESOURCE ECOL LAB, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA.",205,61,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1993,74,"3",NA,NA,NA,778,"791",NA,"10.2307/1940805",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The results indicate that rainfall fluctuations affect the dynamics of the studied population by influencing both the percentage of germination and the number of seeds produced per germinated plant. However, the effect of changes in rainfall on both demographic parameters depends on habitat conditions, with slope subpopulations exhibiting the largest, and wadi subpopulations the smallest, effects. The fact that demographic responses to rainfall fluctuations are habitat dependent has two major implications. First, subpopulations inhabiting different habitats show considerable differences.in their year-to-year fluctuations in density. Secondly, since seed production per seedling is habitat dependent, the distribution of the seedling population among the various habitats is a major determinant of the total number of seeds produced by the population in a given year. The results further indicate that most of the seeds (75-99.9%, depending on rainfall conditions) are produced in the depressions and the wadis, which taken together account for only 10% of the total area. This finding indicates that the ecological conditions in these spatially restricted habitats are critical for the dynamics of the whole population.

In order to characterize the scales of processes determining vegetation patterns during the Holocene, we analyzed a network of 52 pollen sites in the upper Great Lakes region. Pollen percentage data for three dominant tree genera (pine, Pinus; oak, Quercus; birch, Betula) were interpolated from samples bracketing four target years (500, 2500, 4500, and 6500 yr BP). Smoothed isopoll maps of taxon abundance for each target year show broad trends in pollen abundance that correspond to climatic gradients. Residuals, representing the deviation of each pollen datum from the smoothed value, indicate the amount of spatial variation in pollen abundance independent of that already modeled as a broad gradient. The three genera differ in the magnitude and pattern of residual variation. Oak residuals are relatively small in magnitude, while pine and birch residuals are relatively large and show greater local variability in sign and magnitude. This indicates local variability in tree abundance, as pollen of all three taxa is readily dispersed by wind. Spatial correlograms, which summarize the strength of spatial autocorrelation as a function of distance between pairs of sites for a given taxon, were calculated separately for each target year and allow the quantification of the dominant scale of variability of each taxon. Oak correlograms corroborate the mapped data in indicating the dominance of region-wide trends. In contrast the birch and pine correlograms indicate that factors operating at scales of 150 to 300 km are as important as region-wide trends in governing pollen abundances. The structure of the correlograms for birch and pine pollen changes through time, with birch showing a more patchy spatial pattern in the mid-Holocene (4500 and 6500 yr BP) as compared to the late-Holocene (500 and 2500 yr BP). Pine, in contrast, shows a more strongly autocorrelated pattern in the mid-Holocene. Our results suggest that substrate, an environmental constraint on vegetation at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres, has been important in governing the spatial distribution of birch and pine in the upper Great Lakes region. The changing distribution of birch and pine is attributed, in part, to changes in the relative abundance of ecologically dissimilar species within these genera. Further, these observations suggest that spatial scales of tree abundances are dynamic and that constraints imposed by substrate vary in importance in response to long-term climatic variation.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL & BEHAV BIOL, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA","GRAUMLICH, LJ (corresponding author), UNIV ARIZONA, TREE RING RES LAB, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",35,15,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1993,74,"3",NA,NA,NA,826,"839",NA,"10.2307/1940809",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Green Published","2021-05-12"

We conducted experiments in the field and in a growth chamber to determine whether coating soybean seeds with marked strains derived from the biological control agent Bacillus cereus UW85 affected the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of soybeans. We characterized 2651 individual isolates of bacteria from root-free soil and from soybean seedlings based on 43-50 physiological attributes. Discriminant analysis of the bacterial communities according to these attributes showed that the communities of rhizosphere bacteria that developed on nontreated plants and on plants grown from seeds coated with a single strain of bacteria were sometimes dramatically different. This occurred even when the introduced strain did not persist as a common member of the community. In two of four experiments we could as easily differentiate between bacterial communities on roots of UW85-treated and nontreated seedlings as between the communities in the rhizosphere and root-free soil. In the other two experiments we could differentiate only between communities in root-free soil and on roots. In the comparison of bacteria from root-free soil and from the soybean rhizosphere, we found that bacteria from root-free soil were more likely to degrade complex carbon sources than were rhizosphere bacteria, whereas bacteria from roots were resistant to more antimicrobial substances and were able to grow on a wider range of simple carbon sources than were bacteria isolated from root-free soil.","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT PLANT PATHOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT STAT, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",NA,85,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1993,74,"3",NA,NA,NA,840,"854",NA,"10.2307/1940810",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

However, the effects of this compound class on herbivore digestion and assimilation are less well known, particularly with respect to marine herbivores. This study found that the reduction of assimilation efficiency in Xiphister mucosus, a marine herbivorous fish, fed algae treated with marine polyphenolics (phlorotannins) was affected by phlorotannin molecular size (mass). In general, phlorotannins > 16.60 x 10(-21) g > 10 kDa) significantly decreased the assimilation of X. mucosus; those <8.30 x 10(-21) g < 5 kDa) rarely, if ever, had an effect. To determine the ecological relevance of these findings, phlorotannin molecular size profiles were completed for several temperate and tropical brown algal species. In all but one of the algal species examined, the phlorotannins were concentrated in the > 16.60 x 10(-21) g size range. Thus, the size range of phlorotannins that significantly reduced assimilation was also the size range in which they were most concentrated. This work supports the idea that polyphenolics as a chemical class do not all have the same bioactivity, but differ in their activity in a size-dependent manner.

We have chosen to express sediment variables either on an areal or per unit sediment volume basis to avoid bias due to the more common standardization to sediment dry mass (also known as gram dry weight). Cross-system comparisons show that the amount of organic matter present and the sediment water content are important to sediment bacterial abundance. The C:N ratio of the sediment organic matter, possibly reflecting organic matter quality, was found to explain variation in bacterial numbers in addition to that explained by organic content. Over a broad range, sediment water content is related to sediment bacterial numbers in a unimodal fashion indicating dilution of sediments by water at high (> 80%) water content sites and dilution by inorganic particles at low (< 50%) water content sites. In lakes, the most important factors explaining sediment bacterial biomass were sediment water content and hydraulic flushing rate, a finding supported by analysis of an independent data set of English lakes. Planktonic chlorophyll a and planktonic bacterial numbers (both reflecting autochthonous organic matter levels) were not significantly related to sediment bacterial biomass. We found that sediments overlain by epilimnetic water had significantly higher bacterial biomass than those overlain by hypolimnetic water. A strong positive relationship between macrobenthos and sediment bacterial biomass was found for lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Calculations of annual bacterial production and P:B ratios necessary to sustain the macrobenthic population, based on the observed bacterial and macrobenthic biomass and temperature at our sites, indicate that the bacterial biomass present is more than sufficient to maintain the macrobenthos. In addition, based on the observed ratios of bacterial to detrital carbon at our sites and on a range of published assimilation efficiencies for macrobenthos grazing on these carbon sources, we calculated that the mean percentage of carbon of bacterial origin assimilatable by macrobenthos at our sites is 53% with a maximum of 79% and a minimum of 12%. Our results suggest a tighter trophic linkage between sediment bacteria and macrobenthos in our lakes than in most marine habitats, as indicated by published studies.

Individual C. rodgersii, in common with other diadematids, are found in shelters during the day, from which they emerge to forage at night and maintain patches of barrens habitat. The effect of availability of shelter on the foraging behavior of C rodgersii, and on the abundance of benthic invertebrates and algae, was investigated by a field experiment. Physical heterogeneity in the form of large boulders were translocated between the barrens and Ecklonia forest habitats and arranged so as to either maximize or minimize shelter. The fauna and flora on translocated boulders became progressively similar to that found in the surrounding habitat. Most obvious of these changes were reductions in the density of foliose algae on boulders moved from Ecklonia forest to barrens and reductions in the density of limpets in the reverse translocation. C rodgersii recruited to all treatments irrespective of where the boulders came from, where they were moved to, and the amount of shelter provided. The availability of shelter was clearly a sufficient condition for the creation of areas of barrens habitat. The reliance on shelter by these sea urchins makes their local distribution and, therefore, that of the barrens habitat, more predictable than in other temperate regions.","UNIV SYDNEY, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA; UNIV SYDNEY, INST MARINE ECOL, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA",NA,177,59,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,292,"302",NA,"10.2307/1939293",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Here a model is developed to combine these density risk and prey vulnerability components of predation. The model is used to estimate the contribution of predator and prey population overlap to predation risk, and to quantify both density risk and prey vulnerability components of predation risk for two planktonic invertebrate predators and five rotifer prey. Behavioral data from the literature are used to interpret the prey vulnerability values and demonstrate the utility of the model. The predation risk values obtained for each prey species also are compared to the intrinsic population growth rates (r(max)), taken from previous studies.

Experimental manipulation provides particularly useful insight into the biological importance of this variation. Consequently, I undertook a field experiment in which I manipulated body size and evaluated selective predation in order to investigate the ecological and evolutionary significance of phenotypic variation in hatchling turtles. I incubated eggs from 17 clutches of common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) on wet and dry substrates, producing ''large'' and ''small'' hatchlings, respectively. Hatchlings were individually marked, measured, and then released simultaneously at a typical nest site in a National Wildlife Refuge area, Whiteside County, Illinois from which the eggs were collected originally. Subsequently, hatchlings were recaptured in drift fences erected along the edge of the Mississippi River. Sixty-six of 112 hatchling C serpentina were recaptured. Survivorship was not related to clutch, incubation conditions, or locomotor performance, but was significantly size dependent. Natural selection favored larger hatchlings. The strength of selection acting directly on three size traits, as measured by standardized selection gradients (beta'), was 0.327 (PC1 [principal component 1] = overall size and mass), 0.282 (PC3 = plastron length), and 0.162 (PC4 = trade-off between hatchling mass and width). The opportunity for selection was moderate (I = 0.703), but did not constrain selection. Full-sib heritabilities of body size of hatchling turtles were variable (h2wet = 0.72 +/- 0.34 and h2dry = 0.17 +/- 0.28), but were not significantly different between the two moisture treatments. These results provide support for the ''bigger is better'' hypothesis. Larger hatchling Chelydra serpentina exhibited significantly greater survivorship than smaller individuals during movement from the nest site to water. However, larger body size of hatchling turtles may not evolve rapidly because the strength of selection was moderate in magnitude and the heritability was relatively low. These results emphasize the need for more detailed ecological investigations of the early life history of these organisms. Furthermore, this study highlights the utility of experimental manipulations of phenotypic variation for evaluating the potential impact of natural selection on life history evolution.","UNIV CHICAGO, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",NA,222,159,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,332,"341",NA,"10.2307/1939296",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In flight-cage trials providing an easily defensible food source, complete energy budgets (intake, expenditure, and storage) were obtained for two sympatric Costa Rican hummingbirds: a territorial (Amazilia saucerottei) and a low-reward traplining (Chlorostilbon canivetii) species. Behavior and energy responses of solitary birds (controls) were compared to the responses of conspecific and heterospecific pairs competing for a single feeder. Relative to controls, birds in pairs generally spent more time in flight, due primarily to increased rates of visiting the feeder or to agonistic encounters, with a consequent increase in energy expenditure. Ability of birds in pairs to compensate for increased expenditures by increasing intake, thus maintaining a constant body mass over 24 h, depended upon species and dominance status. The greatest asymmetries in energy effects occurred in heterospecific pairs, in which Amazilia aggressively interfered with access to the feeder by Chlorostilbon. In these trials, Amazilia boosted intake sufficiently to maintain adequate rates of energy storage; Chlorostilbon did not increase intake and thus suffered significant loss of energy stores. Conspecific pairs of each species experienced energy effects intermediate to the extreme responses of heterospecific pairs. Individuals of either species had greater energy success when paired with a Chlorostilbon rather than with an Amazilia. For both species, individuals that were relatively more aggressive than their cagemates experienced the greater energy success, though absolute frequency of aggression by an individual was a poor indicator of its energy success. Differential energy response to competition by Amazilia and Chlorostilbon appears to be one mechanism that contributes to local species abundance and guild composition.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT ZOOL,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611",NA,21,21,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,405,"418",NA,"10.2307/1939302",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We evaluated how calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus interacted to influence budworm fitness on artificial diets containing five different levels of the minerals. We quantified survival rates for several life stages using a three-generation bioassay. Data from the bioassay were used to estimate population growth over three complete generations. Performance of the budworm was affected by Mg (linear response for F1 generation; 0.83-1.95 mg/g tested) and P (quadratic response for P1 [parental] and F1 generations; 2.74-4.95 mg/g tested) but was largely unaffected by Ca (0.50-6.81 mg/g tested). Overall, the results suggested budworm performance is best when Mg is at low concentrations and P is at moderate concentrations, and that very high levels of Mg and P are detrimental to the budworm. On average, host trees had too much Mg and too little P for optimal response by budworms. Interactions between Mg and P imply that balances or ratios of minerals are important in budworm nutritional ecology. However, detectable effects from Mg, P, and Ca in the diets diminished as the bioassay continued into the F2 generation, and, consequently, the estimated number of larvae alive at the beginning of the F2 and F3 generations showed no relationship to concentrations of the test minerals. This result probably reflected: (1) the loss of some design points in the second and third generations of the bioassay because larvae did not survive on diets that were markedly suboptimal and (2) increased variability in the population growth response as the experiment continued into the F2 and F3 generations.","ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPT STN,FT COLLINS,CO 80526","CLANCY, KM (corresponding author), ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPT STN,FORESTRY SCI LAB,FLAGSTAFF,AZ 86001, USA.",56,9,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,442,"454",NA,"10.2307/1939306",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanism that generates spatial patterns of pollen dispersal in animal-pollinated plants, namely the combined processes of pollinator movement and pollen deposition, is at present qualitative. I show how easily measured characteristics of pollinator movement and pollen deposition can be used to build models that generate quantitative predictions about pollen dispersal distance. A field experiment in which I followed honey bees (Apis mellifera) foraging on one-dimensional arrays of mustard plants (Brassica campestris) indicated that individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing. I used the model to explore the potential consequences of biased movement and plant spacing for pollen dispersal. Biased movement results in an increase in the expected pollen dispersal distance. In addition, the predicted dispersal distance increased with increasing interplant distance. These results demonstrate that models of pollen spatial dynamics based on individual pollinator behavior can be used to explore the consequences of plant spatial arrangement for gene flow in plant populations.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,CTR POPULAT BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616",NA,64,26,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,493,"500",NA,"10.2307/1939310",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

No species pairs have a positive reciprocal association on regeneration with each other. MOSAIC, a Markov simulation model in which transition probabilities depend on neighborhood species composition, shows that the negative reciprocal association between hemlock and sugar maple of the intensity observed in this study, could lead to spatial separation into monodominant patches over long time periods (3000 yr). The mixed-forest patches are along spatial continua of varying steepness between sugar maple and hemlock patches. Interactions between sugar maple and hemlock overstory and understory trees, along with the pattern of invasion of hemlock, provide a reasonable explanation for the patch structure.

The goal was to evaluate whether mast-fruiting, the synchronous production of large seed crops followed by small seed crops, is simply a response to weather conditions or is actually an evolved reproductive strategy. In this paper, we address four specific questions: (1) Are annual fluctuations in acorn crop size the result of synchronous production of acorns by individuals? (2) Are large acorn crops the result of large flower crops and/or high survival of those flowers to mature fruit? (3) To what extent do weather variables account for variation in acorn production among years? (4) Does acorn crop size correlate negatively with prior acorn production? Red oak and white oak showed a greater degree of mast-fruiting than did black oak. Within a species, individuals tended to produce large acorn crops in the same years, but each species differed in which years they produced large crops. The size of a given acorn crop was determined by both flower abundance and survival of flowers to fruit. Principal components and multiple-regression analyses were used to describe the relationship between weather variables and acorn production. The first principal component explained the largest amount of the variation in black oak (R2 = 0.55) and red oak (R2 = 0.89). In white oak, two principal components combined to explain 77% of the variation in acorn production. The weather variables that were associated with these principal components included spring temperature (positive effect) and summer drought (negative effect). Past acorn production had a major impact on the size of the current acorn crop, with each species showing a different pattern. In black oak, the current acorn crop was negatively correlated with the crop 3 yr prior but positively correlated with the crop 2 yr prior. In red oak, acorn crop size 1, 2, and 3 yr prior had negative correlations with current acorn crop, while acorn crop size 4 yr prior was positively correlated. In white oak, there were negative correlations between acorn crop size and crop size 1, 2, and 4 yr prior but a positive correlation with the acorn crop size 3 yr prior. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast-fruiting species must store resources during some years in order to produce a mast crop. We discuss the possibility that these three species may have inherent cycles of reproduction that are modified by the impact of weather conditions, black oak with 2-yr cycles, white oak with 3-yr cycles, and red oak with 4-yr cycles. We conclude that the patterns of acorn production for black oak, red oak, and white oak are not simply responses to weather events but are also a function of prior reproductive events. This suggests that masting is an evolved reproductive strategy.","WASHINGTON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63130","SORK, VL (corresponding author), UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT BIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63121, USA.",365,87,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,528,"541",NA,"10.2307/1939313",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We investigated whether isolated trees modify the water balance of this ecosystem and if so, what implications this finding might have on models that assume homogeneity of soil water resources. The water balance of the two ecological components of the dehesas-(1) the tree-grass component, and (2) the open areas between the tree canopies with unshaded grass vegetation-was studied for three consecutive years in three locations in the Sierra Norte de Sevilla region of Andalusia in southern Spain. In this region, annual rainfall was generally between 600 and 800 mm, and the summer drought lasted almost-equal-to 130 d. Soil water storage was measured with a neutron moisture gauge outside and under the tree canopy. Deep drainage between two consecutive census dates was calculated using field-measured drainage characteristics. Evapotranspiration (Ea) and surface runoff were computed from the water balance equation assuming that Ea is limited by Penman potential evapotranspiration. Monthly Ea by annual species in open areas was poorly correlated with rainfall levels in the autumn and was limited during the spring by availability of water in the top 40 cm of soil. During summer, monthly Ea by trees ranged from 30 to 50 mm. Mean annual Ea was 400 mm outside and 590 mm under the tree cover. In open areas, water yield (WY), defined as the sum of deep drainage and surface runoff, ranged from 65 to 100% of total Ea, whereas under the tree canopy WY was only 20 to 40% of the Ea. Under the tree canopy, when annual precipitation was < 570 mm, WY was negligible and all precipitation was lost by evapotranspiration. Outside the tree canopy, WY occurred as soon as annual precipitation exceeded 250 mm. Models of competition between trees and grass generally assume a spatial homogeneity of soil hydrodynamic properties. Our results, however, show that both soil water storage and evapotranspiration are greater for the tree-grass component. Consequently, these models must account for this spatial variability in water resources according to species.",NA,"JOFFRE, R (corresponding author), CNRS,CTR ECOL FONCTIONELLE & EVOLUT,BP 5051,F-34033 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE.",269,70,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","MAR",1993,74,"2",NA,NA,NA,570,"582",NA,"10.2307/1939317",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The purpose of this study was to examine this phenomenon. We tested the effects of an abiotic factor (pH) and two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition) on survival and growth to metamorphosis by larvae of two anurans (Hyla gratiosa and Hyla femoralis) in outdoor tanks. Two levels of pH (4.5 and 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30, or 60 embryos per 580 L tank) of each species were arranged in a fractional factorial design and replicated three times. Larvae of H. gratiosa exhibited typical patterns of intraspecific density-dependent responses: as density increased, survival and size at metamorphosis decreased and larval period increased. The interactions of the abiotic factor and the biotic factors were complex in this experiment. The addition of H. femoralis at high pH caused decreased survival and increased larval period of H. gratiosa, but at low pH these negative effects were not detected. Variation in pH had no effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Interspecific competition from H. femoralis caused decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa only at the high initial densities. Some of the responses of H. femoralis were different than those of H. gratiosa. In this species, intraspecific competition affected only the size at metamorphosis. Low pH increased the survival of H. femoralis, but had no effect by itself on any other trait. Increased conspecific density and pH interacted only in their effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. femoralis. Interspecific competition resulted in decreased size at metamorphosis but only increased larval period at the high initial densities. Interspecific competition at the high density interacted with pH to increase survival and size at metamorphosis at low pH in contrast to those results at high pH. Overall, the larval period was the response most strongly affected in H. gratiosa while for H. femoralis the size at metamorphosis was the most strongly affected. Hyla gratiosa had more negative impact on H. femoralis than vice versa. This may be due to the larger body size of H. gratiosa. Low pH enabled H. femoralis to compete more effectively, because the negative impact of H. gratiosa was lessened. Even in a relatively simple simulation, complex interactions occurred between biotic and abiotic factors. This finding demonstrates the importance of multi-factor analysis in furthering our understanding of the structure of assemblages.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA","WARNER, SC (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, 208 MUELLER LAB, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",72,17,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JAN",1993,74,"1",NA,NA,NA,183,"194",NA,"10.2307/1939513",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In a series of microcosm experiments I empirically derived the functional response curves for two common types of stream predators, sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and stonefly larvae (Agnetina capitata), on two behaviorally and morphologically distinct types of mayfly prey (Baetis tricaudatus and Ephemerella subvaria). Data from these separate trials were combined using simple additive models to generate predicted combined functional responses for both types of predator. For both types of prey, actual combined functional response curves (both types of predators together in a treatment) differed significantly from predicted combined functional response for some ranges of prey densities. When Baetis was used as prey, significant departures from the predicted values occurred at moderate and high prey densities and were in a negative direction (interference between predators). When Ephemerella was the prey, significant departures occurred at low and moderate densities and were in a positive direction (facilitation between predators). Additive models for predicting combined predator effects cannot account for non-linearities in combined functional response introduced by non-trophic (behavioral) interactions that occur between fish and stoneflies, and between these predators and their prey. Other aquatic and terrestrial food webs contain similar linkages between vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their prey. Inclusion of behavioral interaction terms seems likely to be a necessary part of any general model predicting combined effects of predators on prey populations in these systems.","UNIV TORONTO,ERINDALE COLL,DEPT ZOOL,MISSISSAUGA L5L 1C6,ONTARIO,CANADA; SIMON FRASER UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,BEHAV ECOL RES GRP,BURNABY V5A 1S6,BC,CANADA",NA,208,80,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JAN",1993,74,"1",NA,NA,NA,219,"225",NA,"10.2307/1939516",7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In central Oklahoma, two species of predaceous, pit-building ant lion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus and M. crudelis) coexist in a narrow, high-density (> 50 animals/m2) zone at the base of sandstone cliffs, where they are sheltered from rain and afternoon sun. Although larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found > 2 m from the cliff base. I used field experiments and observations to test four hypotheses that could explain the maintenance of the ant lion zone: (1) zonation because of habitat availability; (2) zonation because of food availability; (3) zonation because of increased surface temperatures in exposed microhabitats; (4) zonation because of increased soil moisture and disturbance in exposed microhabitats. Ant lions are probably not limited to the cliffbase by the presence of rocks or vegetation, because there was no correlation between ant lion density and available habitat. The availability of prey also does not appear to limit ant lion distribution: ant abundance in pitfall traps was significantly higher outside the ant lion zone than within. Outside the ant lion zone, soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels in the afternoon sun. However, third-instar larvae of M. immaculatus transplanted in dry, sifted soil suffered little mortality over a 4-d period. Larvae transplanted into exposed sites gained significantly more mass than larvae transplanted into the ant lion zone, probably because of differences in food availability. Small-scale manipulations within the ant lion zone revealed that ant lion numbers decreased significantly over a 5-d period in response to both moisture (misting) and disturbance (pit-filling). In a recolonization experiment, the recovery time of patches exposed to a single ''rainfall'' treatment was extremely long: defaunated ''rainfall'' patches did not achieve the pit densities of defaunated control patches until after 84 d. Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Transplant experiments on natural substrata revealed the nature of this interaction. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun. Because both species of ant lions are restricted to a narrow spatial zone, the probability of interspecific and intraspecific interactions (including competition, predation, and cannibalism) is increased. Such interactions may affect the density of both species within the ant lion zone. The abundances of M. crudelis and M. immaculatus were negatively correlated in quadrats from the center of the ant lion zone. Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources. High-density predator aggregations may also affect prey community structure. Arthropod abundance was low within the ant lion zone, perhaps because of direct predation by ant lions or predator avoidance behavior by prey. Although the ant lion zone is caused by the interaction of abiotic factors, high-density predator aggregations have important biotic consequences for the population dynamics of the predators and the spatial distribution of their prey.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",NA,85,29,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JAN",1993,74,"1",NA,NA,NA,226,"237",NA,"10.2307/1939517",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In many webs the proportion of species that are double counted is large; consequently, the ratio of predator species to prey species will inevitably be roughly equal to one.

This computer simulation study examines the effect of complex interactions on the global and local dynamics of metacommunities. Patches are physically identical and differ only in the initial proportion of species that colonize the patches. The random variation is then magnified by deterministic interactions that cause patches to follow different trajectories based on initial conditions. After a period of interaction, individuals from all patches join a global pool of dispersers that colonize a new generation of patches. Complex interactions can have at least two important effects on metacommunity dynamics. First, the number of species coexisting in the metacommunity can greatly exceed the number of species coexisting in any single patch, despite the fact that the patches are physically identical, the species do not differ in colonization ability, and stochastic effects are absent after the colonization stage.

Temporary exclosures (5-7 per site) were moved every 4 wk during the snow-free season to determine ANPP and C Data were collected during 1988, a year of drought and unusually high elk and bison population levels, and 1989, a climatically near-average year, with dramatically fewer elk and bison.

Production and consumption, and consumption and dung deposition were positively correlated across all sites. In addition, sites were grazed when plants were growing. There was a 19% reduction in ANPP from 1988 to 1989, likely caused by death or injury to plants during the 1988 drought. Drought also appeared to be partially responsible for reductions in elk and bison from 1988 to 1989, which were coincident with declines in C and D.

A consistent cycle of seasonal change in assemblage composition occurred each year, little altered by spates. Changes reflected variations in presence or absence rather than relative abundance of taxa. Seasonal patterns were confirmed by plotting temporal changes in densities of common taxa. Invertebrate abundance (mostly oligochaetes and mayflies) peaked in spring. Summer dominants included the gastropod Physella virgata and the caddisfly larva Cheumatopsyche arizonensis. Assemblage composition remained relatively consistent during spring over 3 yr when high discharge was prolonged, whereas there was a major change in autumn community structure between 1984 and 1986, probably reflecting low discharge during a drought in 1986. Drying apparently influenced assemblage composition more than spates, possibly by altering habitat availability and the intensity of biotic interactions as surface stream volume shrank. Assemblage resistance to disturbance by spates was variable. Similarly, resistance of individual common taxa varied within and among taxa, and like assemblage resistance, was not simply a function of spate magnitude or timing (season). Resilience was generally high. Succession rate (degree of change in assemblage composition) declined during succession in all but spring sequences, which displayed no consistent trend. The two summer sequences had highest initial succession rates (in first 30 d postspate), possibly reflecting higher water temperatures, and also exhibited late-successional increases in succession rate. Spatial variation in assemblage composition was uncorrelated with any physical variable measured. Factors known to influence ecosystem-level processes such as primary productivity (e.g., inorganic nitrogen flux, days since spate) also affected community-level aspects such as aquatic invertebrate assemblage composition in Sycamore Creek. Discharge and water temperature had lesser but detectable effects, and probably contributed to the marked seasonality in assemblage composition. Further comparisons of collective properties of ecosystems and communities within other biomes may identify common denominators that characterize responses to disturbance and environmental change.

Mortality rates and the extent of size dependence varied among years and among seasons within years for juvenile and adult fish. When mortality rates were size dependent, large individuals had lower mortality rates than small ones. Differences between habitats in mortality rates were present in some experiments but not others. When there were habitat effects under winter conditions, both juveniles and adults had higher survival rates in a saltwater habitat than in a freshwater one. Some adults survived through the winter in all of our experiments. Adult mortality during the growing season exhibited a similar pattern of habitat effects although at lower mortality rates. Juvenile survival to sexual maturity in the growing season showed no consistent effects of habitat. Fish born during the autumn had a much lower probability of survival to sexual maturity than those born in spring or summer, and there was a threshold time beyond which newborn fish were virtually assured of perishing over the winter, presumably due to the inability to achieve a minimum body size capable of withstanding winter conditions. These experiments illustrate that the net direction of selection on molly body size in any generation depends on events that are stochastic on a yearly scale, such as the climatic severity of the winter and the intensity of predation pressure. Our results illustrate the complex interplay of different sources of selective mortality that operate in natural populations, and highlight the importance of ecological investigations of the different agents of mortality for a predictive understanding of the operation of natural selection.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA","TREXLER, JC (corresponding author), FLORIDA INT UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, UNIV PK, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA.",41,15,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1992,73,"6",NA,NA,NA,2224,"2236",NA,"10.2307/1941470",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The present study was designed to quantify the energy cost and efficiency ([Benefit - Cost]/Cost) of scratch-digging throughout the body size range represented among the Heteromyidae. The resting energy expenditure of bipeds was generally greater than that of quadrupeds on an equal body size basis, whereas their energy expenditure during scratch-digging (DMR) was equivalent. Seed concentration and substrate bulk-density did not markedly affect DMR, but seed concentration did alter the rate of seed harvest. Species differences in seed harvest rate were correlated with mode of locomotion, supporting the hypothesis that bipedality is correlated with specialization of the forelimbs for seed handling. In heteromyids, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was elevated by a factor of 1.5 over basal metabolic rate (BMR); DMR was elevated by a factor of 3.4 over BMR and by a factor of 2.3 over RMR. DMR, seed harvest rate, and the energy cost of scratch-digging on a per seed basis scaled with body mass to the 0.65, 0.31, and 0.33 powers, respectively. Although large bipedal heteromyids harvested seeds at more than twice the rates of small quadrupedal heteromyids, the unequal scaling of DMR and harvest rate makes them less efficient at scratch-digging. In comparison with other heteromyids, the kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops megacephalus) was exceptionally efficient at scratch-digging. Its higher efficiency may allow it to forage on sparsely distributed seeds in open areas where the energy return would be inadequate for larger bipeds. The pocket mouse (Chaetodipus baileyi) was exceptionally inefficient at scratch-digging. Its low efficiency in sand may be correlated with specialization for foraging in pebbly soils. For heteromyids of a given size, factors affecting pouching rate are most likely to determine foraging efficiency because DMR is essentially a fixed cost.","UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,DEPT BIOL,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521",NA,31,23,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1992,73,"6",NA,NA,NA,2260,"2272",NA,"10.2307/1941473",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Over three seasons, 37% of all nests produced at least one fledgling. Over 77% of nests that failed were destroyed by predators. Nests in all 3 yr were clumped in time, with 50% of the nests being started in just 16% of the season. Temporal proximity of other nests (number of other nests started within +/- 2 d) was positively associated with the number of chicks fledged. The probability of avoiding predation increased with number of temporal neighbors even with date of first egg and female age controlled in a multivariate analysis. Clutch size was associated only with settlement date and not number of temporal neighbors nor date of first egg. Breeding earlier by females resulted in higher total success for some measures in some seasons, but early nests failed sooner and more frequently. Returning females bred earlier than new females, and even though their first nests were more likely to fail, they typically renested within the peak of nesting or, if their first nest succeeded, sometimes started a second brood before the end of the season. New females to the study area started nests late, but tended to do so within the peak of nesting thereby improving their chances of success.

The relative demipyramid lengths from the museum specimens were also compared over time, and with human population density, human fishing pressure, and geographic region. The results indicate that relative demipyramid size is indirectly influenced by human activity and varies with geographic region.

Compared with matched nontarget (uneaten) trees, and with whole populations of ponderosa pine, target trees had significantly lower xylem oleoresin flow rates, and significantly lower levels of beta-pinene and beta-phellandrene in the xylem oleoresin. In feeding trials with free-ranging animals, food laced with ecologically realistic concentrations of either beta-pinene or beta-phellandrene were eaten significantly less than control food. The phloem of target trees had significantly higher concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and sodium, and significantly lower concentrations of iron and mercury, than the phloem of matched nontarget trees.

I manipulated levels of simulated folivory on branches within eight trees of Quercus emoryi in a complete randomized block design. Survival and causes of mortality, including attack by natural enemies, of a dominant leafminer, Cameraria sp. nov., were monitored over two growing seasons. Survival varied significantly among trees but not among treatments. Causes of mortality also varied significantly among trees. Death from premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death from bacterial and fungal attack, declined significantly with increasing levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (i.e., intraspecific competition). Simulated folivory in the first growing season did not affect folivory by Cameraria or other folivorous arthropods in the next season. Colonization, survival, rate of attack by natural enemies, and amount of herbivory by other arthropods in the second growing season were not affected by levels of leaf damage in the first one. Neither survival nor causes of mortality of Cameraria in the second growing season were associated with folivory by endemic leafchewing arthropods. Simulated folivory in the first growing season did, however, reduce leaf production in the second season. These results do not support the hypothesis that insect species compete interspecifically via induced plant responses and their effects on the third trophic level (natural enemies of the herbivores). The effects of simulated (first growing season) and insect (second growing season) folivory via induced plant responses on the Cameraria population was negligible relative to intraspecific interactions. Further, my results do not support the notion that folivore-induced responses are defensive and that plants have evolved these responses to manipulate the third trophic level. In natural settings, other factors that influence population dynamics of phytophagous insects, such as intraspecific competition and interactions with microparasites, may obscure any negative effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on interactions among herbivore species and their macroscopic natural enemies.",NA,"FAETH, SH (corresponding author), ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA.",47,17,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1992,73,"5",NA,NA,NA,1802,"1813",NA,"10.2307/1940031",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We studied the association of fugitive plants and stressful physical conditions using salt marsh plants that live in hypersaline bare patches. In New England salt marshes, primary space is dominated by dense monospecific stands of perennial turfs, but disturbances frequently leave bare space that rapidly becomes hypersaline. Elevated salinities of bare patches result from direct exposure of soil to solar radiation and evaporative water loss. A number of fugitive plants that are rare in undisturbed salt marsh vegetation are commonly associated with bare patches before being displaced during secondary succession. Greenhouse studies show that plants that dominate undisturbed vegetation are stunted by high substrate salinities, whereas the photosynthesis and growth of patch-dependent fugitives are relatively independent of typical salinity variation. Moreover, in the field, watering more than doubled the survivorship and growth of seedlings in patches and more strongly affected dominants than patch-dependent fugitives. Our results show that physical conditions in salt marsh bare patches can limit plant colonization, and suggest that high salt tolerances may permit fugitive plants to utilize bare patches as refugia from competitors.

Multiple-regression models using habitat variables accounted for 83% of the variability in species richness of rare coastal plain species but only 45% of that for the background flora.

By defining and naming this entity, we expand our notions of the properties of ecological units, can integrate it with other ecological concepts, and investigate it. Pattern diversity is a measure of the relative arrangement of subunits within an ecological unit, such as communities in a landscape. In tum, pattern diversity has three types: spatial, temporal, and compositional. Compositional pattern diversity is measured as mosaic diversity using a method called affinity analysis. Mosaic diversity measures landscape complexity and is a function of two properties of species patterns: the variation in species richness among communities and the variation in commonness or rarity among species (evenness). A low value of mosaic diversity is indicative of a simple landscape with one or a few underlying environmental gradients and dominated by a few species; a high value is indicative of a complex landscape with many environmental gradients and no ubiquitous species. Statistical inference can be used for determining standard errors and for comparing with null models. Mosaic diversity is relatively insensitive to the number of sites sampled, the number of species sampled, and the intensity of sampling of rare species.

The purpose of the study was to investigate these dynamics in a structured habitat approaching that of their natural habitat in soil, in contrast to previous investigations in broth or chemostats. We addressed three main questions. What are the population dynamics of a phage-bacteria interaction in soil? What role might the heterogeneity of the soil play in shaping the interaction? Are the dynamics controlled more by the population biology of the phage or of the bacteria? The phage used was isolated from Arizona desert soil in which B. subtilis is common. Phage and bacteria were grown separately or together in sterile soil microcosms consisting of autoclaved soil rich in organic material. Densities of phage and bacteria were estimated through repeated sterile sampling of the microcosms by spreading precise dilutions of sampled soil suspensions onto plates of microbiological media. The plates for estimation of phage densities contained in addition a lawn of host bacteria. While the principal focus is on temperate phage ecology, the dynamics of a single example of interaction between B. subtilis and virulent phage is also presented. In all cases an initial epidemic of phage occurred, followed by stable equilibria lasting weeks to months. A threshold host density for phage outbreak occurs at almost-equal-to 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per gram of soil. At equilibrium the phage, both temperate and virulent, were much less abundant than the bacteria. The temperate phage did not depress the equilibrium host density, while the virulent phage lowered it by a factor of ten. The acidic soil of these experiments caused rapid and permanent inactivation of free phage, making the continuous interaction of phage and host essential for persistence of phage. Low levels of phage resistance (superimmunity or genetic) were typical of host populations. Most properties of the interaction between B. subtilis and phage in soil are quite different from those observed with chemostat populations of Escherichia coli and virulent phages. Potential doubling times and rates of increase in soil for phage and B. subtilis were calculated. At equilibrium, soil slows the interaction of phage and host relative to population growth in broth culture, and possibly also makes it heterogeneous in space and time. The life-history features of B. subtilis and temperate phage are considerably more complex than those of non-sporeforming bacteria and virulent phage. The biotic relationship of temperate phage and host may be distinct from predation or parasitism. Patterns in the ecology and evolution of temperate and virulent phage were explored, leading to the expectation that temperate forms will be more common among the phages of soil bacteria.","UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT NORMAL PHYSIOL,TUCSON,AZ 85721; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,CTR MICROBIAL ECOL,E LANSING,MI 48824",NA,43,30,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1992,73,"5",NA,NA,NA,1888,"1902",NA,"10.2307/1940040",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

After a stream is straightened, dredged, or cleared, basin-wide ecologic, hydrologic, and geomorphic processes bring about an integrated, characteristic recovery sequence. The rapid pace of channel responses to channelization provides an opportunity to document and interpret vegetation recovery patterns relative to otherwise long-term, concomitant evolution of river geomorphology. Nearly 150 sites along 15 streams were studied in the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, and Wolf River basins. Channels of these streams, except that of the Hatchie River main stem, have undergone major modifications along all or parts of their courses. This paper presents the eco-geomorphic analyses and interpretation of a large multidisciplinary study, with special reference to the interrelated hydrogeomorphic aspects of channel recovery. Quantitative plant ecological analyses were conducted to infer relative bank stability, to identify indicator recovery species, and to determine patterns of vegetation development through the course of accelerated channel evolution. Binary-discriminant and ordination analyses show that distinctive riparian-species patterns reflect a six-stage model of channel evolution and can be used to infer channel stability and hydrogeomorphic conditions. Woody vegetation initially establishes on low- and mid-bank surfaces at the same location and time that bank accretion begins, and corresponds to the site of initial geomorphic restabilization. The linkage of channel bed aggradation, woody vegetation establishment, and bank accretion all lead to recovery of the channel. Pioneer species are hardy and fast growing, and can tolerate moderate amounts of slope instability and sediment deposition; these species include river birch (Betula nigra), black willow (Salix nigra), boxelder (Acer negundo), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum).

Species with very different morphologies and/or calls forage in different habitats or in different ways. However, bat communities contain many morphologically similar species, which would be predicted to overlap ecologically. We tested the reliability of such predictions and assumptions by investigating the habitat use and diet of two similar species, the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and the long-legged bat (Myotis volans), in southern Alberta, Canada. We recorded the echolocation calls of free-flying individuals and measured wing morphology. The echolocation calls of the two species overlapped in design, although on average the calls of M. volans were shorter and had higher maximum frequency than those of M. lucifugus. Both species had low wing loading and aspect ratio although M. lucifugus had significantly higher values than did M. volans and was thus expected to forage in areas with less environmental clutter. Field observations did not substantiate this, however, We assessed the foraging ecology of the bats by: (1) monitoring species-specific echolocation calls of free-flying individuals, (2) capturing bats in mist-nets set in various habitats, (3) observing the foraging behavior of light-tagged individuals, and (4) assessing the diet from fecal samples. There was no evidence of temporal partitioning of resources by the two species, but some spatial partitioning occurred. Although individuals of both species generally fed in open areas, M. lucifugus foraged primarily low over water while M. volans fed high above the ground and along cliff edges. Neither fed consistently in cluttered areas despite wing and echolocation call designs that should permit such behavior. Despite the overlap in foraging areas, the diets of the two species differed significantly. Myotis volans ate primarily lepidopterans while M. lucifugus ate a wider variety of prey, including dipterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans. Our results suggest that there are several levels at which morphology influences the ecology of insectivorous bats. Large differences may influence foraging-habitat choice by restricting some species to certain habitats. At another level, however, we suggest that small differences influence prey availability rather than habitat availability. Bats may select habitats based on the distribution of suitable prey rather than due to direct limitations imposed by morphology or echolocation call design.","UNIV CALGARY,DEPT BIOL SCI,DIV ECOL,BEHAV ECOL GRP,CALGARY T2N 1N4,ALBERTA,CANADA",NA,150,54,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","AUG",1992,73,"4",NA,NA,NA,1335,"1345",NA,"10.2307/1940680",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The standard deviation in delta-C-13 and delta-N-15 in naturally obtained foods like fish during 6 yr was almost-equal-to 1 parts per thousand. Factory-manufactured pellets generally gave lower deviations (0.2 parts per thousand for delta-C-13 and almost-equal-to 0.6 parts per thousand for delta-N-15). Feathers showed an enrichment relative to food in both C-13 and N-15, although its extent varied among different bird species. Isotope ratios for C-13 and N-15 from diet to feathers converged. The nature of the enrichment factors is discussed in relation to the convergence and temporal window size. Neither enrichment showed an age dependency among adult birds, and neither depended on the nitrogen content in the bird's diet.

I sampled these species in January and August near the extremes of their altitudinal distributions in Puerto Rico. Hollow electroformed copper lizard models, randomly positioned within habitats occupied by the lizards, served as operative temperature (T(e)) thermometers, providing baseline predictions about basking rates and T(b) of nonthermoregulating lizards. Comparison of the basking behavior and T(b) of lizards to the basking rates and temperatures of the models provided unambiguous evidence of nonrandom thermoregulatory activity in some of the lizard populations. Although basking opportunities were similar in the habitats occupied by both species, basking rates differed markedly: A. cristatellus basked more frequently than did randomly positioned models, and its basking rates were higher at high elevation and in January; A. gundlachi used basking sites at random at both elevations in both months. In addition, A. cristatellus limited its activity, particularly at high elevation, to times when operative temperatures were relatively high or basking sites were available (i.e., sunny weather). As a result of its opportunistic basking activity, mean T(b) of A. cristatellus was often elevated above mean T(e), and A. cristatellus populations experienced only limited variation of mean T(b) with elevation and season. In contrast, A. gundlachi mean T(b) approximated mean T(e), and the T(b) of A. gundlachi varied more with elevation and season. Mean T(b) in A. cristatellus was always higher than the mean T(b) of A. gundlachi at every elevation and month combination. The data also suggest that the low T(b) experienced by A. gundlachi at high elevation might dramatically reduce sprinting ability, whereas the T(b) experienced by A. cristatellus allows a majority of lizards at high elevation to sprint quickly.",NA,"HERTZ, PE (corresponding author), COLUMBIA UNIV BARNARD COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,NEW YORK,NY 10027, USA.",167,37,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","AUG",1992,73,"4",NA,NA,NA,1405,"1417",NA,"10.2307/1940686",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Existing overlap indices do not account for the size-/stage-structured nature of these populations. In this paper I present new overlap indices that use information about the sizes of individuals that co-occur in time and space to predict the potential for interactions in size-structured guilds. An index of the opportunity for competition (IOC) calculates the frequency with which similar size classes of two species encounter each other, whereas an index of the opportunity for intraguild predation (IOP) calculates the frequency of encounters among disparate size classes of the same two species. To illustrate that these indices are more appropriate for size-structured populations than conventional indices, I calculated overlap, IOP, and IOC for all species pairs in a diverse assemblage of dragonfly larvae. The new indices revealed size-specific patterns of overlap that were not detected by the conventional index, including that (1) some species with high overlap values should interact mainly as competitors, others mainly as intraguild predators, and many as both competitors and predators, (2) subtle differences in phenology and/or size-specific shifts in habitat distribution can lead to the potential for asymmetric interspecific interactions, (3) some species with low pairwise IOP and IOC values are nonetheless vulnerable to the effects of diffuse competition or intraguild predation, (4) seasonal segregation reduces competitive overlap but at the same time increases the opportunity for intraguild predation.

The present study couples a description of distributional and abundance patterns of unpigmented clones of Daphnia pulex at a low-arctic site with manipulation experiments that test the environmental and biological variables responsible for generating these patterns. The descriptive studies, carried out in 1985 and 1989, revealed 36 clones in 150 habitats with individual ponds containing an average of 1.7 and a maximum of 5 clones. Distributional patterns and relative abundances of the clones were stable over the 4-yr interval. Three clones dominated the assemblage, comprising > 75% of the animals. One of these clones dominated saline habitats while the other two displayed a checkerboard distribution in low-salinity ponds. The latter distributional pattern appeared linked to the presence of a predatory copepod, Hesperodiaptomus arcticus, in some ponds. Manipulation experiments showed that abiotic variables (e.g., salinity) played a role in excluding clones from some habitats, but that many habitats were invasible by a broader spectrum of clones than was ever detected in them. Experiments showed that clones were ordinarily superior in their home environments, supporting the role of competition in limiting local richness. The experimental results were not totally congruent with the clones' natural distributions, as one clone became dominant in all of the low-salinity manipulation ponds. This outcome was reversed by introducing H. arcticus into ponds. The results confirm that clonal diversity is maintained by physical and biological variation in the system, and demonstrate that substantial taxon diversity can be sustained in the absence of marked ecological divergence.",NA,"WILSON, CC (corresponding author), UNIV GUELPH, DEPT ZOOL, GUELPH N1G 2W1, ONTARIO, CANADA.",47,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","AUG",1992,73,"4",NA,NA,NA,1462,"1472",NA,"10.2307/1940690",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Thus, the demography of the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum was analyzed with a matrix population model. This was built on a 3-yr study in two populations on the Swedish west coast, where > 1100 individuals were marked and followed twice each year. The environmental variability is due to the presence of ice during some of the winters. The frequency of ice years in the study area is known, and is higher at one site compared to the other. During the study there were 2 yr with ice and one without at both sites, and these temporal changes in the environment resulted in large variations in the vital rates of A. nodosum. The individuals were divided into five size classes and the population dynamics at years without ice were characterized by low mortality rates and high transition probabilities for growth to larger sizes, while years with ice had high mortality rates and high transition probabilities for breakage to smaller sizes. Of the 25 possible transitions in the life cycle graph all except 2 had nonzero entries, which means that the adult life of A. nodosum individuals can be described as plastic growth between all five size classes. A crude estimate of the recruitment showed that both populations will increase in numbers in ice-free years, but will decrease in years with ice. The size-dependent fertility rate is probably subject to errors, and thus the survival matrices were scaled with a fertility function built on total reproductive biomass per individual, allowing analyses of the demography at different levels of the asymptotic growth rate lambda(1). One of the main differences between the populations was that the stable size distribution for survival matrices in ice-free years was dominated by size class 4 at one population but class 5 at the other. Thus, to achieve the same value of lambda(1) higher fertility rates were needed at the population dominated by class 4. Elasticity analysis of the transition matrices showed the same trend, although the main result from that analysis was that growth to larger sizes or remaining in the same class contributed more to lambda(1) than reproduction. This was valid for all levels of lambda(1) investigated.",NA,"ABERG, P (corresponding author), UNIV GOTEBORG,DEPT MARINE BOT,CARL SKOTTSBERGS GATA 22,S-41319 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.",97,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","AUG",1992,73,"4",NA,NA,NA,1473,"1487",NA,"10.2307/1940691",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In laboratory studies, neighbors inhibited growth, while flow velocity exerted a negative effect on growth rates of isolated colonies but had no influence on growth rates of colonies with neighboring Electra upstream. There were no significant effects of neighborhood or flow on zooid dimensions. Field experiments, which only tested the influence of neighbors on growth, revealed a similar reduction in growth in the presence of neighbors. The growth responses displayed by Electra do not support predictions of adaptive strategy models: despite its noted range in colony morphology, Electra did not assume more runner-like shapes when growth conditions were poor. Rather, growth of Electra appeared to be a result of local astogenetic (colonial ontogenetic) rules. Colonies that fed from similar flows to those they had experienced in the laboratory provide evidence backing the common assumption that patterns of feeding result in growth responses and so may be related to fitness in colonial animals. Evidence that growth patterns resulted from feeding rates suggests a central role for the acquisition of food in the dynamics of benthic assemblages of suspension feeders.","DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT OCEANOG, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA",NA,61,13,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","AUG",1992,73,"4",NA,NA,NA,1502,"1513",NA,"10.2307/1940693",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The total density and the predation rate on dummy nests increased as the proportion of agricultural land increased. This supports the suggestion that the density of corvids increases as forest becomes fragmented and intermixed with agricultural land, causing an increase in nest predation in small forest fragments. However, the different species responded differently to the proportion of forest in the landscape. The two forest-living corvids, the Jay and Raven, were absent from small forest fragments in a matrix of agricultural land and mainly preyed upon dummy nests inside the large forest fragments. Thus, both of these species were habitat specialists restricted to forests. Three corvids basically inhabit agricultural land, the Hooded Crow, Jackdaw, and Magpie. The Jackdaw and the Magpie showed a strong preference for agricultural land and they mainly preyed upon dummy nests in agricultural land. On the other hand, the density of Hooded Crows was higher in landscapes with a mixture of agricultural land and forest than in landscapes dominated by either agricultural land or forest, indicating a use of both agricultural land and forest. Further, Hooded Crows regularly preyed upon nests in both forest habitat and agricultural land; it is a habitat generalist. Therefore, the Hooded Crow was the most important species in the corvid family, causing increased predation pressure close to forest-farmland edges and in small forest fragments surrounded by agricultural land.","UNIV UPPSALA,DEPT ZOOL,S-75122 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","ANDREN, H (corresponding author), GRIMSO WILDLIFE RES STN,S-73091 RIDDARHYTTAN,SWEDEN.",466,136,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1992,73,"3",NA,NA,NA,794,"804",NA,"10.2307/1940158",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

To round out an energy analysis of seabirds spanning the full range of body sizes in the northwest Atlantic, the field metabolic rates (FMRs) of breeding Leach's Storm-Petrels were measured using doubly labeled water techniques (DLW). Metabolic, dietary and, demographic data were used as inputs in a populations energetics model to estimate the energy requirements and prey harvests of the Leach's Storm-Petrel population of eastern North America. FMRs of storm-petrels that remained in burrows averaged 83.3 +/- 19.4 kJ/d. FMRs increased significantly with time (i.e., x in hours per day) at sea (y = [85.8 +/- 6.5] + [3.13 +/- 0.48]x), and metabolism at sea was estimated to be 161 +/- 18 kJ/d. FMRs integrated over activity on land and activity at sea averaged 124 kJ/d during incubation and 142 kJ/d during chick rearing. Incubating adults weighed significantly more than adults rearing chicks, although adult mass did not vary with age of chick. Basal metabolic rate (BMR, measured as O2 flux) averaged 2.02 +/- 1.01 cm3.g-1.h-1, equivalent to 45.4 +/- 30.4 kJ/d, very similar to values obtained for breeding conspecifics in the Bay of Fundy and in the Bering Sea. Thermal conductance averaged 0.124 +/- 0.065 cm3.g-1.h-1.degrees-C-1. FMR/BMR ratios averaged 2.73 for incubating birds and 3.13 for birds rearing young. Population energetics modelling indicated that during a 7-mo breeding period Leach's Storm-Petrels at colonies in the northwest Atlantic Ocean consume > 74000 Mg of prey, mostly myctophids and amphipods (mostly Hyperia galba), as well as euphausiids (mostly Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and other prey (decapods, copepods, isopods). Leach's Storm-Petrels make up approximately 80% of the breeding seabird population in eastern Canada, but owing to small body size and metabolic efficiency, they account for comparatively little of the energy that flows through the avian assemblage of the northwest Atlantic. An intra-specific, inter-colony difference in FMR is suggested: FMRs measured in a Newfoundland colony were significantly higher than those determined with the same DLW procedure in the Bay of Fundy near the southern limit of the species' breeding range in the northwest Atlantic. Differences in ambient temperatures and wind speed associated with different oceanographic regimes may generate energetic differences. Like inter-colony differences in feeding ecology, inter-colony differences in FMR need to be considered in population and community energetics models and in meso- and mega-scale extrapolations.","MEM UNIV NEWFOUNDLAND, DEPT PSYCHOL, ST JOHNS A1B 3X9, NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA; MEM UNIV NEWFOUNDLAND, CTR OCEAN SCI, ST JOHNS A1B 3X9, NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA; FISHERIES & OCEANS CANADA, SCI BRANCH, MONCTON E1C 9B6, NB, CANADA","MONTEVECCHI, WA (corresponding author), MEM UNIV NEWFOUNDLAND, DEPT BIOL, ST JOHNS A1B 3X9, NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA.",48,18,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","JUN",1992,73,"3",NA,NA,NA,823,"832",NA,"10.2307/1940160",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Green Accepted","2021-05-12"

Field experiments included manipulations of perceived risk using predator urines and simulated predator encounters with a dog (Canis familiaris). Compared to foraging animals, sleeping porcupines of all age classes avoided high risk (i.e., open) areas. Mass loss varied by habitat with individuals foraging in open areas (high risk) experiencing less mass loss than those foraging in groves (low risk). Age class also affected habitat use by foraging porcupines. Juveniles invariably remained in low-risk areas, even when more risky habitats contained potentially better quality forage.

A 15-mo, whole-lake experiment revealed direct and indirect mechanisms by which a fish predator structured its prey population, primarily by affecting recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish. Piscivorous Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were added to two of four sections of a divided lake in eastern Finland previously stocked with crucian carp (Carassius carassius). Although the stocked crucians quickly grew beyond vulnerable sizes, recruitment of their offspring through their 1st yr of life was reduced by 90% in sections with perch. Surviving YOY in predator sections were completely confined to vegetated inshore areas. This restriction to refuges lowered their growth rates in comparison with YOY in predator-free sections, which can further reduce recruitment by prolonging susceptibility to size-limited predation and decreasing energy reserves needed for anaerobic overwintering. In the presence of piscivores, surviving prey subsequently benefit from reduced intraspecific competition, increasing growth rates to achieve large, invulnerable body sizes rapidly. Resulting populations of crucian carp, consisting of relatively few but relatively large individuals, contrast with populations living in the absence of piscivores, which are characterized by high densities of small, stunted individuals. Such divergent population patterns are displayed by a number of prey species in Scandinavia and North America, suggesting that a combination of direct and indirect effects of predation on younger age classes, such as documented for crucian carp, may be common in fish populations of small northern lakes. Detecting these patterns and identifying their underlying mechanisms may often require a combination of extensive and intensive studies.","UNIV JOENSUU, DEPT BIOL, SF-80101 JOENSUU 10, FINLAND","TONN, WM (corresponding author), UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT ZOOL, EDMONTON T6G 2E9, ALBERTA, CANADA.",134,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1992,73,"3",NA,NA,NA,951,"958",NA,"10.2307/1940171",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Tree ring and growth form patterns of black spruce (Picea mariana) remains lying on the ground in a lichen-tundra community were used to reconstruct, within a 4600-m2 quadrat, the structure of a conifer stand at the time of the bum (approximately AD 1750). The prefire spruces were the last members of a long regenerative sequence leading to maintenance of a lichen-spruce stand formed after a bum approximately 1700 yr BP. At this time postfire recruitment was most likely facilitated by favorable climatic conditions. Before the 1750 fire event the krummholz was predominantly maintained by layering, due to severe climatic conditions at least since the beginning of the Little Ice Age (approximately AD 1580). The site was deforested by the 1750 fire, because of the limited regenerative potential of stunted spruce. Postfire spruce exclusion has been responsible for major environmental changes associated with a thinner snow cover. Along the border of the deforested site snow cover depth was controlled by living spruces, whereas postfire shrubs (mostly dwarf birch, Betula glandulosa) of the lichen-tundra stand were unable to trap drifting snow. A significant decrease in thickness of the snow cover following deforestation was deduced from a comparative analysis of stem morphology of prefire spruces and present snow conditions. Inception of gelifluction lobes and mudboils was also caused by a change in the soil thermal regime associated with a reduced snow cover.

Grasslands of each region were simulated under ungrazed and observed grazing intensities to establish reference points for sensitivity analyses using a wide range of grazing intensities and different microbial biomasses. The consequences of patchy carbon and nitrogen deposition were also simulated. Results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes are affected differentially by grazing in the shortgrass and tallgrass regions. Net nitrogen mineralized by the microbial biomass in the shortgrass simulations declined from the ungrazed condition at low grazing intensities, and proceeded to increase from moderate to high grazing intensities. Plant nitrogen uptake was significantly correlated with net mineralization, and soil mineral nitrogen levels were greatest at moderate grazing intensities. In tallgrass simulations, soil mineral nitrogen increased with grazing intensity; net nitrogen immobilization occurred over much of the grazing intensity range because of low decomposition substrate quality. Tallgrass plant nitrogen uptake responded to urine nitrogen input to the soil and was uncorrelated with net mineralization. The potential for nitrogen competition between grasses and microbes was greater in the tallgrass than in the shortgrass because of lower total system nitrogen and lower grazing intensity in the tallgrass. The ecosystem-wide soil nitrogen gradient of the Serengeti governs most properties of nitrogen cycling, while within-region edaphic conditions and grazing create significant variation in local ecosystem processes.","SYRACUSE UNIV,BIOL RES LABS,SYRACUSE,NY 13244; UNIV ALASKA,INST ARCTIC BIOL,FAIRBANKS,AK 99701","SEAGLE, SW (corresponding author), UNIV MARYLAND,CTR ENVIRONM & ESTUARINE STUDIES,APPALACHIAN ENVIRONM LAB,FROSTBURG,MD 21532, USA.",89,64,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1992,73,"3",NA,NA,NA,1105,"1123",NA,"10.2307/1940184",19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Such diel periodicity may be an adaptive response that minimizes exposure to visually hunting, drift-feeding fishes. I tested this risk-of-predation hypothesis by examining drift behavior of mayflies in a series of Andean mountain and piedmont streams that vary in the abundance of drift-feeding fishes. Drift was primarily nocturnal in piedmont streams with natural populations of visually hunting predators. In contrast, mayfly drift activity did not differ between day and night in mountain streams that historically lack drift-feeding fishes. However, in naturally fishless Andean streams containing introduced rainbow trout, nocturnal peaks in drift were observed for the mayfly Baetis, suggesting a rapid evolutionary change in behavior in response to an exotic predator. When drift periodicity was examined along a gradient of predation regimes, activity was found to be increasingly restricted to the nighttime hours as predation risk became more intense. Diel periodicity was observed even when fish were experimentally excluded, suggesting that nocturnal activity has evolved as a fixed behavioral response to predation, and is not a direct ecological consequence of diurnal feeding by fishes. These observations support the hypothesis that predation risk is important in determining the timing of prey drift behavior.","UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT ZOOL,COLLEGE PK,MD 20742; UNIV OTAGO,DEPT ZOOL,DUNEDIN,NEW ZEALAND",NA,218,58,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1992,73,"2",NA,NA,NA,438,"448",NA,"10.2307/1940751",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Sexual selection favors large males because they win more territorial contests than do smaller males, and females mate only in the vicinity of defended tree holes (i.e., passive female choice). Small males behave as territory holders until displaced, and/or act as subordinate satellites at large territories. Females are more predictably found in forest light gaps, even though they oviposit in both gap and understory tree holes. Males defended only 14% of the sites used by ovipositing females. Large tree holes are relatively rare, but support a greater number of emerging adults per season and produce larger adults than tree holes containing less-than-or-equal-to 1 L of water, which rarely produce more than one individual per season. By defending only large tree holes in gap areas, a male increases his chances of mating, and of producing multiple offspring and reproductively successful sons. Results from a field experiment suggest that both mate acquisition and procurement of superior larval habitats have been selective pressures in the evolution of male territory choice. Because even large holes are inadequate to support a female's entire clutch, and the presence of conspecific and heterospecific odonate larvae makes offspring survival uncertain, selection favors a female that partitions her clutch among multiple tree holes.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST, MIAMI, FL 34002 USA","FINCKE, OM (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.",58,13,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1992,73,"2",NA,NA,NA,449,"462",NA,"10.2307/1940752",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Poecilochirus carabi Can. is a holarctically distributed mite that rides between patches of carrion on the bodies of carrion beetles (Silphidae, Nicrophorus). Using behavioral tests, we demonstrated differences in local host specialization of P. carabi at two sites in Michigan, the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) and the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS). At KBS, Nicrophorus orbicollis and N. tomentosus each supported a strict host specialist. These KBS orbicollis- and tomentosus-specialists differed significantly in both body size and a measure of dorsal setal lengths. Laboratory crosses between specialists were not successful, suggesting that the specialists are distinct species. At UMBS, in contrast, such strong specialists were not found. Mites preferred two beetle species, N. tomentosus or N. defodiens (a species not found at KBS), over all others, but moved between these two species readily. UMBS mites all resembled the KBS tomentosus-specialist in morphology. No orbicollis-specialist mites were found at UMBS, despite the high relative abundance of N. orbicollis in the beetle community. We raised mites from each site on all available hosts to test whether preference for a host species was associated with higher fitness in association with that host species. Although P. carabi were able to reproduce in association with any Nicrophorus species, mites at UMBS had the highest reproductive success on the two species that they preferred. Each KBS specialist mite was raised in association with N. tomentosus and N. orbicollis. While the tomentosus-specialist had significantly higher reproductive success in association with its preferred host species, the orbicollis-specialist showed no difference in reproductive success between the two host species. However, when the pattern of dispersal on beetles was considered, a difference in fitness between the two hosts was apparent. This difference in dispersal pattern was due to an interaction between the parental behavior of the two host species and mite generation time. We discuss the evidence for trade-offs in this system and the use of interspecific comparisons in the analysis of specialization.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060",NA,36,15,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1992,73,"2",NA,NA,NA,463,"478",NA,"10.2307/1940753",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We found that newly hatched larvae from eggs collected from a population using plantain were heavier than those from a population using turtlehead. Nonetheless, both the prediapause and postdiapause larvae derived from the turtlehead population and fed turtlehead in a laboratory experiment gained more mass than those from the plantain population fed plantain. Collections of diapausing larvae from field sites corroborated that pattern. Regardless of the population source (i.e., those using either turtlehead or plantain), postdiapause larvae reared on turtlehead exhibited higher relative growth rate (RGR), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) than those fed plantain, even though approximate digestibility (AD) and leaf nitrogen concentrations were lower for turtlehead. Regardless of their population of origin, choice tests showed that newly hatched larvae preferred turtlehead. Likewise, adult females reared from larvae collected from both populations oviposited exclusively on turtlehead. Both C. glabra and P. lanceolata contain iridoid glycosides. The iridoid glycoside profile of butterflies reared on these two plants differed, reflecting the differences of the host plants. The shift of some populations of E. phaeton onto plantain is most likely a function of several ecological factors rather than genetic differentiation between populations using turtlehead and plantain.","UNIV COLORADO,DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGANISM BIOL,BOULDER,CO 80309; SUNY BINGHAMPTON,DEPT BIOL SCI,BINGHAMTON,NY 13902; HARVARD UNIV,MUSEUM COMPARAT ZOOL,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138","BOWERS, MD (corresponding author), UNIV COLORADO,COLORADO UNIV MUSEUM,CAMPUS BOX 334,BOULDER,CO 80309, USA.",86,38,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1992,73,"2",NA,NA,NA,526,"536",NA,"10.2307/1940758",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The functional response consists of two components: the intake rate while foraging and the time available for food searching. In generalist herbivores an interaction may exist between those two components, because the quality of food eaten (expressed as digestibility) may limit the period available for grazing. Thus, variation in intake rate while foraging in relation to food availability may give a biased estimate of functional response in such animals. We studied the relationship between the different components of functional response during winter for a generalist browser, the moose Alces alces, by comparing the intake rates of free-ranging individuals foraging on three Norwegian winter ranges of different quality. The intake rate was determined by collecting feces defecated during a 24-h period by radiocollared individuals. The amount of food eaten was found by multiplying the dry mass of feces with the inverse of the digestibility of the twigs eaten during that period. No relationship was found between intake rate and either snow depth or temperature. Body mass accounted for a large proportion of the variance in intake rates. The slope in the regression of intake rate on body mass (b = 0.73) was close to the one expected from Kleiber's law. However, when calves and adults were analyzed separately, a significant allometric relationship was found only for the calves. The intake rates of both age groups increased linearly with resource availability. This relationship also remained after accounting for the effects of body mass in a multiple-regression analysis. The intake rate also increased with the digestibility of the twigs eaten. However, twig digestibility was closely correlated with resource abundance in the present data set, so the separate effects of quality and quantity were difficult to estimate. In the present data set no significant relationship appeared between resource availability and the time used for foraging. Thus, the functional response of winter-foraging moose was linearly related to the resource availability. However, we suggest that the quality of the food also should be included in the computation of functional response curves of large herbivores. Consequently, the functional response should be described in three dimensions as a function of quality and quantity of the food resources.",NA,"ANDERSEN, R (corresponding author), NORWEGIAN INST NAT RES,MAMMALIAN ECOL RES GRP,TUNGASLETTA 2,N-7004 TRONDHEIM,NORWAY.",46,24,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1992,73,"2",NA,NA,NA,542,"550",NA,"10.2307/1940760",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Analysis of this has most often been based on asymptotic (local) stability analysis of equilibria at which all species are present, on the grounds that a configuration with an unstable equilibrium is less likely to occur in the real world than one with an asymptotically stable equilibrium. Since species may also coexist on limit cycles or chaotic orbits, we argue that a global condition that species should increase when rare could be more appropriate. Conditions for such permanence exist and their use makes it possible to focus on fundamental qualitative questions of coexistence of species, even though the quantitative properties of their dynamics may be very complex. We describe a straightforward and general method for distinguishing between permanent and nonpermanent Lotka-Volterra food webs; this method is due to Jansen (1987). A numerical analysis of four-species food webs with different degrees of omnivory shows that many that would be rejected as unstable in a local analysis are at the same time permanent in the global analysis. Using permanence methods, food webs of high connectance are shown to rebuild themselves more readily than those of low connectance, and therefore to recover more readily from disturbance than those of low connectance.

I found no evidence that self replacement or reciprocal replacement act to maintain the current community composition. Gapmaker-gapfiller comparisons indicated preferential replacement of all species by Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), suggesting that the community is undergoing successional change. Nor did gap size, location within a gap, or local canopy composition appear to exert a strong influence on the species composition of regeneration within the gap. The only circumstance where Pacific silver fir was not overwhelmingly dominant among gapfillers was on stumps, where almost all successful western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) gapfillers were located. These patterns suggest that neither species-specific interactions between gapmakers and gapfillers nor variability in gap environments is adequate to maintain the current composition of the forest canopy.

The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance. In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low-stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbance. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.","UNIV SHEFFIELD, NERC,COMPARAT PLANT ECOL UNIT, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",NA,201,134,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,15,"29",NA,"10.2307/1938717",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The genus is subdivided into complexes comprised of species with similar morphologies, physiological abilities, and percentage of (guanine + cytosine) comprising their nuclear DNA. Here, we test the hypothesis that ecological factors influence the types of toxins produced by members of two Pichia complexes (the Pichia kluyveri and Pichia opuntiae complexes). Members of each complex are separated by geography or host range, but all live in decaying cactus tissue. Similarities among killer toxins were investigated by testing strains from each complex in the laboratory for their ability to kill a standard set of 70 yeasts. Principal components analysis demonstrated that the killer phenotype was constant within a species, but not within the complexes. The probability that a toxin would kill a particular yeast depended on some ecological characteristic of the yeasts tested as sensitives (i.e., the region, host plant, or habitat from which the yeasts were collected). We further tested the hypothesis that ecological factors influence killer phenotype by analyzing within-community patterns of killing. Killer strains from two different cacti were tested for their ability to kill a subset of the yeasts actually collected from the same pockets of rotting cactus tissue from which the killer strains were collected or from rot pockets in neighboring cacti. When the yeasts tested for sensitivity were classified a priori by their probability of interacting with each killer strain, it was shown that the sensitivity to killer toxin was correlated with the probability of interaction. Further, the yeast community composition of a rot pocket depended on the presence or absence of a killer strain in that pocket. We demonstrated that killer toxins could change community composition by growing strains of two sensitive yeasts in the presence of a killer or a non-killer strain of P. kluyveri. The killer strain reached a higher cell density than the non-killer strain in the presence of sensitive yeasts. The density of sensitive yeasts grown with a killer strain was lower than that of a strain grown with a non-killer strain of P. kluyveri.","SYRACUSE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SYRACUSE,NY 13244","GANTER, PF (corresponding author), BARRY UNIV,SCH NAT & HLTH SCI,11300 NE 2ND AVE,MIAMI,FL 33161, USA.",35,4,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,54,"67",NA,"10.2307/1938720",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.","UNIV MONTREAL,DEPT SCI BIOL,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,QUEBEC,CANADA",NA,79,33,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,99,"117",NA,NA,19,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Short (Eustachys paspaloides) and mid-height (Themeda triandra) grasses from the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, were grown for 12 wk in a balanced factorial experiment. Treatments combined clipping and canopy closure, simulated by raising an opaque cardboard collar as plant height increased. At harvest, plants were separated into morphological parts, dried, weighed, and analyzed for nitrogen (N) and nonstructural carbohydrates (CHO). Simulated canopy closure of unclipped plants reduced photon flux density at the plant base by 12% perpendicular to the light source and 55% at a 45-degrees- angle from the lights. Multivariate analysis revealed that experimental treatments produced completely distinct results. Simulated canopy closure of undefoliated plants more than doubled plant height, reduced tiller number by 65% in the short grass and 90% in the mid-height grass, converted differentiation from production of many small tillers to a few very large tillers, changed allocation patterns toward more stem and sheath, and shifted the short grass from a CHO-dominated economy to a more N-balanced economy. The time course of yield from defoliation reached a decided. maximum at 9 wk in the short grass but was much lower and remained comparatively constant in the mid-height grass. Comparing clipped-unshaded plants (simulating grazing) with unclipped-shaded plants (simulating no grazing) revealed that, for both grasses, compensation for defoliation was complete in total yield, yield of live tissues, crown mass, root mass, and total number of leaves. Neither species compensated in residual leaf mass, total leaf area, leaf area per unit of plant biomass, or stem mass. Defoliation shifted leaves of both species to lower CHO and higher N concentrations. In general, the short grass was modified more by canopy closure, the mid-height species by clipping. Greater defoliation tolerance of the short-statured species was due to much greater tillering, significantly greater N accumulation, greater allocation to leaf blade and sheath, less allocation to crown and root, a greater foliage concentration per unit canopy volume, a lower rate of foliage death, and the ability to sustain a considerably higher leaf area per unit of plant mass. This experiment indicated that growing unclipped plants isolated in pots grossly distorts morphology, growth, and chemical properties compared to plants experiencing the canopy closure normally encountered in ungrazed grasslands. Therefore, failure to account for the self-limiting consequences of canopy closure can mislead conclusions from laboratory experiments designed to test the consequences of defoliation.",NA,"MCNAUGHTON, SJ (corresponding author), SYRACUSE UNIV,BIOL RES LABS,SYRACUSE,NY 13244, USA.",50,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,170,"182",NA,"10.2307/1938729",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

At daily intervals, unparasitized aphids and aphids that were parasitized at age 24, 48, 72, and 120 h (corresponding to nymphal instars L1-L4) were dissected.

The growth in DM of unparasitized aphids followed a sigmoid curve. Aphids that were parasitized by A. ervi continued to grow for 5-7 d before their DM started to decline. Trajectories of the parasitoid's growth during its larval and pupal stages could be described by nonlinear equations. The maximum larval DM and the time from oviposition to adult eclosion of parasitoids varied with host age at parasitization, and thus suggested differences in host quality.

Under adequate temperature and light conditions, grasshopper body temperatures may exceed air temperatures by 10-degrees-15-degrees-C with both nymphs and adults preferring to thermoregulate near 40-degrees-C, their optimal temperature for development. Comparison of age-specific phenology data collected from field sites with projections from computer simulation studies on grasshopper development, indicated that incident solar radiation can highly accelerate maturation of grasshoppers. Also, prolonged exposure to temperatures above 35-degrees-C is beneficial to grasshoppers, as it is detrimental to the fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli (US pathotype I), which is a major cause of natural mortality in many species. E. grylli protoplasts grew little or not at all if incubated at a constant 35-degrees-C in tissue culture medium. Studies, conducted in vivo at constant temperatures, verified that E. grylli has an upper thermal limit of survival and development near 35-degrees-C. In nature, however, these organisms are exposed to fluctuating temperatures. Further in vitro studies revealed that protoplast survival and development were significantly affected by incubation at 40-degrees-C for as little as 2 h per day and almost totally inhibited by 40-degrees-C for 8 h each day. In vivo incubation studies also showed an increase in the incubation period and a decline in the proportion of grasshoppers dying of E. grylli mycosis with increased daily exposure to 40-degrees-C. Infected grasshoppers were also held at 25-degrees-30-degrees-C and allowed to range freely between shaded and lighted areas, so body temperatures could be raised through normal basking activity. Compared to a control group held in diffuse light, E. grylli mycosis was almost totally eliminated from the basking grasshoppers. The few individuals treated with solar radiation that died from E. grylli infection survived significantly longer then infected individuals not exposed to the solar simulator. Computer simulations using field-collected temperature, moisture, and solar radiation data revealed that behaviorally regulated thermal effects on E. grylli survival and development could limit disease development in some locations and seasons. Although it is unclear that the behavioral trait of basking is an adaptive response to selection pressures caused either by the pathogen or by other selective factors, it is clear that thermoregulatory behavior provides survival advantages to C pellucida. In addition to their specific biological significance, these results demonstrate that behavioral exploitation of a physical resource in the environment can be used to profoundly alter biological relationships between species, in this case, allowing one organism to eliminate an antagonist by causing its mortality.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT STAT & BIOMETRY,ITHACA,NY 14853","CARRUTHERS, RI (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,USDA ARS,PLANT PROTECT RES UNIT,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",114,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,190,"204",NA,"10.2307/1938731",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In accordance with predictions from current ecological theory, the regression line of planktonic algal biomass vs. the concentration of total phosphorus shows a steeper slope for Swedish (functionally three trophic levels) than for Antarctic lakes (functionally two trophic levels). This difference suggests that, besides the effect of nutrients, the food chain composition in aquatic systems has a crucial impact on the biomass development of planktonic algae. However, at very high productivity, phytoplankton biomass in the Antarctic lakes approached levels similar to those in Swedish lakes, suggesting that the algae grew away from being grazer regulated and instead became nutrient limited.

Increases in group size and aggregation, decreases in flow velocity, and central and downstream positions within an aggregation all lead to increases in fertilization success.

We characterized variation in diet among and within individual tiger salamander larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) among and within sites in natural ponds. We also analyzed prey variation among sites. There was significant variation in diet among sites, controlling for variation in larval size among sites. Prey taxa varied significantly among sites. There were also significant size-associated differences in diet within sites. Controlling for larval size we found no further evidence of significant interindividual differences in diet within sites. Intrapopulation variation in diet among sites is likely a consequence of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in feeding behavior of individuals on a spatially variable prey assemblage. This result supports Van Valen's hypothesis that selection should favor multiple phenotypes within populations. Variation in diet among sites is directly analogous to the within- and between-phenotype components of niche variation defined by Roughgarden. Size-associated differences in diet represent a significant ontogenetic component to niche variation in feeding within populations of larval salamanders. Studies of food web structure that ignore predator diet and prey differences among sites are an incomplete summary of predator-prey linkages. In addition, phenotypic plasticity in feeding behavior as a source of niche variation has implications for traditional ecological theory of intra- and interspecific interactions, which has rarely included variation other than morphological size differences among animals.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287",NA,41,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,268,"279",NA,"10.2307/1938738",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The first approach uses a multistate capture-recapture model that is parameterized directly with the transition probabilities of interest. Maximum likelihood estimates are then obtained numerically using program SURVIV. The second approach involves a modification of Pollock's robust design. Estimation proceeds by conditioning on animals caught in a particular class at time i, and then using closed models to estimate the number of these that are alive in other classes at i + 1. Both methods are illustrated by application to meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, capture-recapture data. The two methods produced reasonable estimates that were similar.

The study was carried out between 1982 and 1985 on four 30-ha plots of temperate deciduous forest within and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. Experimental food reduction using aerially sprayed Bacillus thuringiensis created significant differences in caterpillar biomass between one sprayed and two unsprayed plots throughout the breeding season in 1983. Where caterpillar abundance was reduced, Black-throated Blue Warblers made significantly fewer nesting attempts and diets of nestlings included fewer caterpillars. Clutch size, hatching success, and number of young fledging per nest did not differ among the food reduction site and controls. Also, the reduced number of nesting attempts per pair on the food reduction site in 1983 did not significantly lower production of young per pair. No detectable differences in caterpillar biomass between sprayed and unsprayed sites were created in 1984 or 1985 because natural caterpillar abundances were already low. Natural declines in food abundance for Black-throated Blue Warblers occurred from 1982 through 1985, primarily because of a decrease in caterpillar abundances. Significant reductions in number of young fledging per nest, nestling growth rates and survival, and number of nests attempted per pair corresponded with the natural decline in food abundance. Of those measures, a reduced number of nesting attempts per pair lowered annual production the most. When effects of food limitation were calculated separately from those of nest predation, food limited annual breeding productivity to below that needed to balance annual mortality in at least one of the four years of this study. These findings indicate that neotropical migrant bird species are probably limited periodically by food when breeding in north-temperate habitats.","DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA",NA,189,44,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","FEB",1992,73,"1",NA,NA,NA,357,"372",NA,"10.2307/1938747",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We conducted two field experiments to determine if a plant's pollination and subsequent reproductive output reflect local densities of conspecific and heterospecific flowers. We controlled floral composition in the neighborhoods surrounding 12 focal plants of self-compatible Besleria triflora (Gesneriaceae) and of self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), producing prescribed mixtures of flowers of the focal plants' conspecifics and of Cephaelis elata (Rubiaceae). Each experiment subjected each focal plant to four different treatments: a floral neighborhood of 10 conspecific flowers and 10 of Cephaelis within a radius of 20 m (Treatment A); 90:10 (B); 10:90 (C); and 50:50 (D). Focal plants themselves always had 10 open flowers. We assigned the sequence of treatments to each focal plant in a Latin square crossover design using three balanced blocks of four plants each. Dependent variables were: frequency of hummingbird probes per flower; pollen tubes in styles; and seed output per flower. From standard models of competition for pollination, we predicted that pollination levels and seed production would be ranked among treatments: B(90:10) > D(50:50) > A(10:10) > C(10:90). These overall predictions were supported for both Palicourea and Besleria, based on tests for directionality showing that the rank order among adjusted treatment means did not differ from the order predicted. Separate a priori treatment contrasts indicated that in both species increasing flower density above base levels (Treatment A, 10:10) by adding conspecific flowers alone (B, 90:10) or along with Cephaelis (D, 50:50) increased the rate at which hummingbirds visited focal plants' flowers. In Palicourea, both the number of pollen tubes in styles and seed output per flower increased in the same fashion. In Besleria, the only effect was increased pollination (but not seed output) from A (10:10) to B (90:10). In contrast, enriching the basic neighborhood (A, 10:10) with Cephaelis flowers (C, 10:90) did not alter frequencies of hummingbird probes to either species of focal plant. Heterospecific enrichment did, however, decrease both pollination levels and seed output in Palicourea, and seed output in Besleria. In general, altering the floral neighborhood affected Palicourea more strongly than Besleria. Apparently the intensity of density dependence, at least in terms of female reproductive success, varies among plant species sharing pollinators. Seed outputs in self-incompatible plants such as Palicourea may closely reflect flower densities of neighbors, but interspecific effects on fertilization in self-compatible plants such as Besleria may be density vague.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195","FEINSINGER, P (corresponding author), UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT ZOOL,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611, USA.",147,51,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,1953,"1963",NA,"10.2307/1941550",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Here we use a (known) method that determines species interactions more realistically, within the framework of the community to which they belong. This ''inverse'' method evaluates all the effects that one species experiences from another, both direct and indirect. We use this method to study the classical (though highly controversial) ''competition community,'' where each species is considered (in the ''isolated pair'' approach) to suffer from the presence of every other. The model we use takes account of the fluctuations in interaction coefficients that one must expect in the real world, both from one species pair to another, and as the effect of ambient environmental variations. Remarkably, the ''inverse'' method finds that generally a high proportion (20-40%) of the interactions must be beneficial, or ''advantageous,'' when not lifted out of the community context in which they actually occur. The contrary case, called here ''hypercompetitive,'' in which each species suffers from every other species, can occur only if the environment is nearly constant, and the species closely akin to each other, with both of these conditions holding and persisting to a degree that must be considered implausible. The results of the model remain valid, even after incorporating a number of major structural modifications, thus indicating robustness in its predictions. We survey the available field data and show that they are in good general agreement with the conclusions reached, on the high proportion of interactions which must be ''Advantageous in a Community Context'' (ACC).","MONASH UNIV,GRAD SCH ENVIRONM SCI,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA","STONE, L (corresponding author), GRIFFITH UNIV,NATHAN,QLD 4111,AUSTRALIA.",92,19,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,1964,"1972",NA,"10.2307/1941551",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Inferred climates at 3000-yr intervals from 18 000 years ago to the present, based on six taxa (spruce, birch, northern pines, oak, southern pines, and prairie forbs), were used to generate time series of simulated isopoll maps for these taxa and seven others (hickory, fir, beech, hemlock, elm, alder, and sedge). The simulations captured the essential features of the observed isopoll maps for both sets of taxa, including differences in migration patterns during the past 10000 yr that have previously been attributed to differential migration lag. These results establish that the continental-scale vegetation patterns have responded to continuous changes in climate from the last glacial maximum to the present, with lags less-than-or-equal-to 1500 yr. The inferred climatic changes include seasonality changes consistent with orbitally controlled changes in insolation, and shifts in temperature and moisture gradients that are consistent with modelled climatic interactions of the insolation changes with the shrinking Laurentide ice sheet.

Hence, there is an increasing research effort to elucidate the structure and function of ecological boundaries. Yet traditional data analysis methods focus primarily on homogeneous units rather than on the boundaries between them; thus, new methods are being developed for detecting, characterizing and classifying boundaries, e.g., split moving-window boundary analysis (SMW). SMW is a simple yet sensitive method for locating discontinuities that may exist within multivariate, serial data (ordered in one dimension) at various scales relative to the length of the data series. However, SMW is subjective and relative, and therefore locates apparent discontinuities even within random, serial data. In this paper we present two nonparametric methods for determining the statistical significance of discontinuities detected by SMW. First, we describe a Monte Carlo method for determining the statistical significance of scale-dependent discontinuities (i.e., discontinuities that are significant relative to only one scale). Second, we propose a nonparametric, scale-independent method (it also is dependent upon scale size, but to a much lesser degree than the Monte Carlo method) that is more appropriate for locating statistically significant discontinuities that separate different, relatively homogeneous groups of varying size along a series. We examine the robustness of these two methods using computer-generated data having varying intensities of imposed discontinuities, and illustrate their application to locating boundaries between vegetation samples collected at systematic intervals across a desert landscape in southern New Mexico, USA.","SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,SYST ECOL RES GRP,SAN DIEGO,CA 92182",NA,88,10,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,2057,"2070",NA,"10.2307/1941559",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Total cast production was estimated from field population estimates, soil climate data, and cast production-temperature relationships obtained in the laboratory. The organic matter and mineral N and P contents of surface casts by month were used to estimate total processing of these substances in the field. Earthworms present in the study sites were Diplocardia longiseta, D. kansensis, D. rugosa, D. singularis, D. smithii, D. verrucosa, and the European species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion cyaneum. Estimated total cast production and nutrient processing by Diplocardia spp. exceeded that of exotics in both soil types, in spite of higher populations of Lumbricidae in one soil. Total annual soil consumption by all earthworms was 4-10% of the A-horizon, depending on soil type. Organic matter equivalent to 10% of total soil organic matter in the top 15 cm or to 100-300% of plant annual belowground production appears to pass through the earthworms each year. Mineral N processed was almost-equal-to 10-12% of annual plant N uptake, comparable to half of the input from precipitation, while the P processed was equivalent to 50% of annual uptake.

We conducted experiments designed to: (1) examine multiple trade-offs between predator avoidance, feeding behavior, and copulation duration in a semiaquatic insect (Microvelia austrina); and (2) address the influence of altered copulation duration on male reproductive success. To examine multiple trade-offs, we used a 2 x 2 factorial design where we measured the amount of time that mating microveliids remained in tandem, for starved and fed microveliids in the presence and absence of predaceous water striders (Gerris remigis). We also looked at the effects of presence vs. absence of green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) on microveliid tandem duration. To address the impact of premature pair separation on male mating success, we separated paired microveliids in field populations and measured the time required for each sex to find new mates. To examine the effects of local sex ratio on remating times of males and females, we quantified the sex ratio of field populations via periodic censuses and correlated local sex ratio with remating times. Finally, to address oviposition rates while pairs are in tandem, we measured female oviposition patterns relative to tandem duration for poorly fed and well-fed females. Both starvation and gerrid presence significantly reduced tandem duration. As a result of male-biased sex ratios, males that prematurely separated from females often faced long search times before securing a new mate. Females oviposited at a constant rate while in tandem. A simple computer simulation incorporating the above observations suggests that reductions in tandem duration can decrease fertilization rates.","UNIV KENTUCKY,TH MORGAN SCH BIOL SCI,BEHAV & EVOLUTIONARY ECOL RES GRP,LEXINGTON,KY 40506",NA,40,9,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,2123,"2136",NA,"10.2307/1941564",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Instead, it is often assumed that treatment differences in movement parameters will extend, over long periods of time, into treatment differences in long-term, net displacements from a point of origin. I use diffusion models to show that this assumption is not necessarily correct, thus indicating that treatment differences in movement behaviors should be interpreted with caution. In addition, for organisms whose long-term movements can be represented by simple diffusion, I provide formulae that allow calculation of whether treatment effects on movement parameters would be likely to produce treatment differences in long-term displacements.

I then assessed the extent to which species-specific distributions were correlated with habitat availability and the potential for interspecific competition to modify patterns of abundance and resource use. The six common cottid species were Artedius fenestralis, A. harringtoni, Asemichthys taylori, Chitonotus pugetensis, Icelinus borealis, and Jordania zonope. A comparison of their observed distributions with the distributions of microhabitats along the transects revealed that all species demonstrated significant affinities for or avoidance of many of the predominant substrates: clean rock, silt rock, shell sand, gravel, mud, and algae. Using a stepwise regression technique, I found that the densities of individual cottid species were significantly correlated with the percentage cover of these substrate types along the transects and with transect depth. Several lines of evidence suggest that interspecific competition does not play a strong role in this assemblage. Species pairs that co-occurred on at least some transects did not show disjunct distributions. Microhabitat overlap of these species pairs was higher in sympatry (comparison of transects with both species present) than in allopatry (comparisons of transects with only one species present), counter to the expectation of niche divergence. Correlations of species densities after correcting for habitat heterogeneity with the Schoener-Crowell-Pimm technique revealed only one significant negative density correlation out of thirty potential correlations. Cottid diversity was not correlated with structural diversity along transects in spite of strong associations of each species with habitat structure. This suggests that the transect areas were undersaturated in the number of individuals and/or species of cottid fishes. The apparent lack of competition among subtidal cottids contrasts with studies on intertidal fish communities dominated by cottids for which there is observational evidence of interspecific competition.","UNIV WASHINGTON,FRIDAY HARBOR LABS,FRIDAY HARBOR,WA 98250","NORTON, SF (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,FISHERIES RES INST,620 UNIV RD,FRIDAY HARBOR,WA 98250, USA.",34,19,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,2181,"2192",NA,"10.2307/1941569",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Data on survivorship and fecundity (clutch size, per capita clutch frequency) were assessed and compared to previously published life table statistics for the slider turtle, Trachemys scripta, in the same body of water and for the yellow mud turtle, K. flavescens, in Nebraska. The annual survival rate for adult female Kinosternon (87.6%) is significantly higher than that of adult female Trachemys (77.4%). Similarly, male Kinosternon exhibit an annual survival rate (89.0%) significantly higher than that of male Trachemys (83.4%). The mean annual proportion of female Kinosternon that are reproductively active (50.7%) also is significantly higher than that of Trachemys (37.2%). In addition, survival rate from the time eggs are laid by Kinosternon until the hatchlings enter the aquatic environment (26.1 %) is significantly higher than that for Trachemys (10.5%). Comparisons of our findings with those for K. flavescens indicate that these geographically separate populations of congeneric species also differ substantially in age at maturity, mean generation time, and the mean proportion of females that are reproductively active in any given year. Differences were also apparent in mean clutch frequencies and adult survival rates. The differences in life history traits between the two geographically separated populations of congeners seem to be as great as those between the two syntopic populations representing different families (Kinosternidae: K. subrubrum and Emydidae: Trachemys scripta). The comparison of life tables for two species from different families having different ecological and evolutionary histories, but living in the same habitat, and of congeneric species in different habitats, is instructive regarding the biological flexibility of species under natural conditions. However, the study suggests that environmental variability has a greater effect on life table statistics than do phylogenetic relationships.","SAVANNAH RIVER ECOL LAB, AIKEN, SC 29802 USA","FRAZER, NB (corresponding author), MERCER UNIV, DEPT BIOL, MACON, GA 31207 USA.",62,29,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,2218,"2231",NA,"10.2307/1941572",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator. Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences. Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287; ARIZONA GAME & FISH DEPT,NONGAME BRANCH,2221 W GREENWAY RD,PHOENIX,AZ 85023",NA,24,15,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,2232,"2239",NA,"10.2307/1941573",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We also tested how illumination and habitat structure affected rates of predation by owls on the two gerbil species. In a large aviary, we manipulated presence and absence of owls, owl species, presence and absence of illumination, and shrub cover. In response to the presence of owls or to increased illumination, gerbils foraged less, shifted foraging activity to the bush microhabitat, and quit patches at a higher giving-up density of resources. In accord with moonlight avoidance, both gerbil species suffered higher predation rates under illumination than in the absence of illumination. In addition, G. pyramidum distinguished among owl species, as indicated by changes in patch use and habitat selection. Habitat structure also affected foraging behavior and rates of predation. Gerbils foraged less in the open than in the bush microhabitat, foraged less when there was no cover present, and foraged less in the bush microhabitat when patches were encumbered by entangling branches. In accord with avoidance of open areas, both gerbil species suffered higher rates of predation when shrub cover was 0% than when shrub cover was 10%. With 0% cover, G. allenbyi suffered higher predation rates than G. pyramidum, but with 10% cover, rates of owl predation did not differ between gerbil species. Rates of owl predation on the two species corresponded to their natural patterns of macro- and microhabitat partitioning; relative to G. allenbyi, G. pyramidum predominates on open sand dunes and biases its behavior toward the open microhabitat. The results suggest that predation interacts with resource competition to determine the distribution and habitat separation of G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,CHICAGO,IL 60680","KOTLER, BP (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84993 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL.",436,206,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","DEC",1991,72,"6",NA,NA,NA,2249,"2260",NA,"10.2307/1941575",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Two attributes of the vegetation, the amount of aboveground biomass (in grams) and the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennial species, predicted 76% of the variation in species density. The success of the predictor variables suggests that competitive intensity, as reflected in biomass levels, and the time elapsed since the last disturbance event, as reflected in the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennials, are important determinants of local variation in species density. The model was then tested against independent data from shoreline vegetation in southeastern Ontario, Canada. There were no significant differences in the two data sets in their response to the two independent variables in the full model.

The interactions among predators and the potential role of those interactions in headwater stream communities was examined in 16 replicated experimental streams. I examined the ecological interactions among four species of co-occurring predators, adult Salvelinus fontinalis (98-122 mm standard length [SL]), larval Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (36-58 mm snout-vent length [SVL]), larval Eurycea bislineata (13-21 mm SVL), and Cambarus bartonii (6-17 mm carapace length [CL]), in an experiment that began in mid-June and ran for 3 mo. Brook trout affected both survival and growth of the larger salamander species, Gyrinophilus, and Salvelinus and Gyrinophilus affected the growth of the smaller salamander Eurycea and the crayfish Cambarus. The presence of Gyrinophilus had no effect on relative condition or fecundity of Salvelinus. Larger predators caused Cambarus and Eurycea to alter their activity levels and habitat, but Gyrinophilus made no adjustments to the presence of Salvelinus. Results demonstrate that Gyrinophilus is vulnerable to predation/aggression from brook trout, but that Eurycea and Cambarus are able to behaviorally avoid predation by both large predators at a significant cost to growth. The effect of brook trout on the two species of salamander in the experimental streams parallels the observed differences between salamanders in trout and trout-free waters in the field. Thus, interactions among predators in headwater streams directly and indirectly influence population dynamics of the interacting species by affecting survival, growth, behavior, and habitat use. The interactions among these predators can determine, in part, the predation environment experienced by individuals at lower trophic levels.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",NA,87,24,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1991,72,"5",NA,NA,NA,1782,"1793",NA,"10.2307/1940977",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Small-mouthed species that feed predominately on grasping prey (e.g., crabs, isopods, gastropods) were predicted to have low capture success on an elusive prey (shrimp) and to use kinematics more consistent with suction-feeding mechanisms; large-mouthed species that feed predominately on elusive prey (e.g., fishes, shrimp) were predicted to have high capture success in attacks on shrimp and to use ram-feeding kinematics. Laboratory experiments in which predators were videotaped in attacks on either hippolytid shrimp or cancrid crabs tested both the attack success and kinematic predictions. Small-mouthed cottid species had significantly lower attack success on shrimp (20-41% vs. 45-56%) than did large-mouthed cottids. Both groups had similar high success rates in attacks on crabs on a sand surface: 93-100% for small-mouthed species and 85-95% for large-mouthed species. Most small-mouthed cottids used attack kinematics more typical of suction feeding (e.g., shorter predator-prey distances and slower attack velocities) than did ram feeders. One small-mouthed species, Jordania zonope, used attack kinematics similar to those used by large-mouthed cottids in attacks on shrimp, and had higher capture success than other small-mouthed species, but had significantly lower capture success than large-mouthed species. All predators showed some ability to modify their attack kinematics when attacking prey with different escape tactics, but cottids showed little intraspecific variation in attack kinematics, in contrast to several recent studies of the strike mechanics of lower vertebrates. These results emphasize the importance of both mouth morphology and attack kinematics in determining interspecific differences in capture success and, perhaps, diet. The success of the simple predictions presented here provides hope that general predictions of foraging ecology may be derived from morphological patterns when the prey are treated not by their taxonomic affinities but by the functional demands they make on their predators.","UNIV WASHINGTON,FRIDAY HARBOR LABS,FRIDAY HARBOR,WA 98250","NORTON, SF (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,FISHERIES RES INST,620 UNIV RD,FRIDAY HARBOR,WA 98250, USA.",136,23,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","OCT",1991,72,"5",NA,NA,NA,1807,"1819",NA,"10.2307/1940980",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Diaptomus birgei exhibited behaviors ranging from strong preferences for some taxa of cyanobacteria to almost complete rejection of other taxa when allowed to feed in low-concentration mixtures of a high-quality green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardi, and each of 16 taxa of cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate the overriding importance of chemical factors. Copepods exhibited very high clearance rates for some filaments and colonies but rejected morphologically similar strains shown to contain potentially toxic compounds. Responses to resource abundance exhibited three patterns, each consistent with the assumptions and predictions of an optimal diet model. First, selectivity for high-ranking cyanobacteria declined in high-concentration mixtures with Chlamydomonas relative to selectivity in low-concentration mixtures. Second, a test of the effects of time without food showed that hunger, rather than food concentration per se, was responsible for these shifts in selectivity. Finally, each toxic strain was consistently ingested at very low rates, even when offered as the sole food resource. Experiments with complex mixtures of natural seston revealed similar patterns of consistently strong discrimination against a presumably toxic cyanobacterium and concentration-dependent selectivity for presumably nontoxic taxa. Our results show how the behavioral flexibility of copepods can be adaptive in lakes with significant populations of cyanobacteria. The ability of copepods to feed size-selectively on filaments and colonies and to discriminate against toxic forms suggests that these grazers may be important in the evolution and continued success of toxic strains.","INDIANA UNIV PURDUE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, FT WAYNE, IN 46805 USA","DEMOTT, WR (corresponding author), INDIANA UNIV PURDUE UNIV, CROOKED LAKE BIOL STN, FT WAYNE, IN 46805 USA.",224,50,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","OCT",1991,72,"5",NA,NA,NA,1820,"1834",NA,"10.2307/1940981",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Availability of planktonic cyprid larvae also was measured at site A. There was a strong concordance between cyprid availability and settler density over the main settlement period among intertidal heights, where each was inversely related to intertidal height. Differences in cyprid availability with intertidal height were related to immersion time as the larvae, in general, were uniformly distributed at the water-substratum interface. Settlement rate was strongly correlated with cyprid availability in the low intertidal zone al site A, where most settlement occurred. In all zones at both sites, recruit density at the end of the main settlement period was a positive function of settler density over this period: on average, 79% of the variation in recruit density was explained by settler density over the main settlement period. Adult density and total settler density also tended to be strongly related: 86% (mid zone at site A) and 73% (high zone at site B) of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density, except where postrecruitment mortality (i.e., predation) was high (e.g., only 1% of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density in the low zone at site A).

Associative effects occur when one diet item affects the digestion (either positively or negatively) of another diet item. Feeding trials were conducted with an opportunistic omnivore, the yellow-bellied slider turtle (Trachemys scripta scripta), on three diets: duckweed, insect larvae, and duckweed/larvae mix. Diet had a significant effect on digestibilities and intake, but not on transit time. There was a significant associative effect in the duckweed/larvae diet. For all diet components except lipids, the digestive efficiencies measured in the duckweed/larvae diet were significantly greater than those predicted from the digestive efficiencies for duckweed and larvae diets when fed alone. The presence of larvae in the digesta significantly improved the digestive processing of duckweed, probably by supporting greater numbers or diversity of cellulolytic microbes. A given mass of duckweed provided almost-equal-to 70% more energy and 20% more nitrogen to the turtle when ingested with insect larvae than when ingested alone. Associative effects should be incorporated in optimal foraging models and studies of diet selection because the value of a diet item can vary with the foods with which it is ingested. The assigned value must include not only the direct nutritional gain from the item, but also the indirect nutritional gain (or loss) through positive (or negative) effects on digestion of food items with which it is ingested.","UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ZOOL, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA","BJORNDAL, KA (corresponding author), UNIV FLORIDA, CTR SEA TURTLE RES, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.",91,18,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","AUG",1991,72,"4",NA,NA,NA,1234,"1241",NA,"10.2307/1941097",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Increases are more likely for iteroparous than for semelparous life histories, and are more likely when the increase in food availability is of short duration. The possibility of starvation makes it more likely that foraging effort will decrease with increasing food density. Organisms whose foraging goal is to minimize mortality are especially unlikely to increase effort in response to increased food availability.

In this paper I am proposing a unified framework for studying individual movements that brings both of these approaches together. The proposed framework is based on the diffusion-approximation procedure developed by Patlak (1953a, b), which translates a probabilistic description of the pattern of individual movements (such as provided by simulation models) into a partial differential model describing the population redistribution in a patchy habitat. My first goal in this paper was to make Patlak's work accessible to ecologists interested in realistic movement models. Secondly, making some simplifying assumptions I solved Patlak's model to obtain the equilibrium distribution of organisms among patches in a heterogeneous environment. This led me to a definition of residence index. The residence index of a patch is estimated by observing and recording movement trajectories of organisms within the patch. The pattern of variation in the residence index among different kinds of patches specifies the predicted equilibrium densities of organisms in each patch. I assessed the utility of the above approach by using data on movement tracks of Euphydryas anicia females to calculate butterfly residence indices in host-plant patches vs. nonhost environment. The predicted distribution of butterflies among host and nonhost areas differed by only 16% from the actual distribution, as documented by an independent data set. I also applied the model to data from three studies on insect movement and spatial distribution. The accuracy of model predictions varied from adequate to excellent. Finally, I argue that Patlak's model and its residence-index extension provides a general, and at the same time realistic, framework for quantifying individual movements, and for relating movement patterns to spatial population dynamics. Although this approach, as developed here, is explicitly concerned only with population redistribution within an area, birth/death or immigration/emigration terms can be added in a straightforward manner. Thus, this framework can be very useful in studies of consumer-resource (e.g., predator-prey or herbivore-host) spatial dynamics, since movement behaviors of consumers searching for prey, and prey attempting to avoid consumers, are known to be important in affecting the outcome of such population interactions.",NA,"TURCHIN, P (corresponding author), SO FOREST EXPT STN,2500 SHREVEPORT HIGHWAY,PINEVILLE,LA 71360, USA.",277,101,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","AUG",1991,72,"4",NA,NA,NA,1253,"1266",NA,"10.2307/1941099",14,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We investigated the importance of food value and refuge value in determining the plant utilization patterns of the herbivorous marine amphipod Ampithoe longimana. When offered a choice of five common seaweeds, this amphipod fed most readily on Dictyota and Hypnea and less readily on Sargassum, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum. Rates of feeding on the different seaweeds were unrelated to seaweed gross morphology, toughness, nitrogen, or protein content. When cultured on each of these seaweeds in the laboratory, amphipod survivorship was high on Dictyota (82%), intermediate (35 and 18%, respectively) on Sargassum and Hypnea, and low (0%) on the other seaweeds. Survivorship on the different diets was strongly correlated (r = 0.930) with algal protein content; however, neither protein content nor amphipod performance on the different diets was significantly related to feeding rates on those diets. Additionally, amphipods from the three seaweed species that produced some survivors did not differ in growth rate, fecundity, egg size, or age at first ovulation. Variance in survivorship, and related measures, among sibling groups of amphipods suggested that this amphipod population possessed heritable variation for performance on the different seaweed species. In the field, abundance of A. longimana on the different species of algae was more clearly related to the preference of omnivorous fishes for these algae than to feeding rates of the amphipods when given those algae in the laboratory. A. longimana was more abundant on Dictyota and Sargassum (both unpalatable to omnivorous fishes), than on Hypnea, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum (all of which are palatable to fishes). During the season when omnivorous fishes were abundant, density of A. longimana increased on Dictyota, which is chemically defended from fishes, but decreased or remained unchanged on the seaweeds that are more palatable to fishes. Competition with other amphipods as a group did not appear to explain the distribution of A. longimana among seaweeds, since there were no negative correlations between A. longimana abundance and total amphipod abundance in any month. The lack of any consistent relationship between host-plant use in the field and either feeding preference or diet value, as measured by survivorship and reproduction, suggests that host-plant use by A. longimana may be strongly constrained by requirements for shelter from predation.",NA,"DUFFY, JE (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",268,65,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","AUG",1991,72,"4",NA,NA,NA,1286,"1298",NA,"10.2307/1941102",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

If patch size affects densities of residents then larger patches should have higher densities compared to smaller patches because larger patches often have greater habitat diversity and lesser chances of stochastic events destroying the population. If patch size affects length of time animals spend on patches (persistence rates) then smaller patches should have lower persistence rates compared to larger patches because smaller patches contain fewer resources. Larger animals may be constrained by body size, as well as population size, to reside only on the larger patches because smaller patches do not contain enough resources. If successional changes affect resident animals that are host specific on colonizing plant species, then the effects may be noticeable immediately following field abandonment because plant species replacement rates are most rapid then. Four small mammal species were included: Sigmodon hispidus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus. The field was divided into patches that varied in area by two orders of magnitude with patches of each size treatment placed in each section of the field. Patch size effects on densities and persistence rates of the four mammal species were tested with analyses of variance. Plant species were grouped according to seven life history traits so as to include relative percent cover of most plant species. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify which variables (patch size, field sections, and percent relative cover) significantly explained variations in small mammal densities. Effects of patch size on animal densities and persistence rates varied among animal species. The largest species, Sigmodon hispidus, was never found on the smallest patches, but densities of Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus were often highest on the smallest patches. Animal density variations were often significantly explained by patch size using multiple regression analyses (P less-than-or-equal-to .001). However, lack of consistent trends with respect to the other independent variables included in the equations and variable R2 values suggested that other, unmeasured, variables may have influenced the results. Persistence rates of the three species were often highest on the largest patches. Results suggested that animals visited small patches more often than large patches without staying, and used large patches to create territories.

Plants were cloned, put in controlled environments mimicking the natural photo-thermoperiod, and subjected to light grazing pressure by a generalist-feeding North American grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes. Carbon assimilation and redistribution were measured in the short term with an infrared gas analyzer and C-11-labelled CO2, coupled with a three-compartment analytical model, and by harvesting whole plants at the end of a 12-wk regrowth experiment. Results documented several significant differences between the GA and NGA samples, suggesting the evolution of physiological traits related to C assimilation, translocation, and storage in response to previous grazing history. Pregrazing net C-fixation rates, translocation rates, and C-storage pools were identical for the two ecotypes. After grazing, overall C-fixation rates were 39% higher for the GA plants, and the regrowth data suggest they remained higher than NGA rates throughout the experiment. Removal of < 10% of initial green-leaf biomass by grazing at each grazing period produced major differences in carbon flux between the two samples. Throughout the experiment GA plants produced and stored more C in leaves, stored less C in stem sinks, had higher phloem activity, and translocated more of the labile C to roots where it was stored in higher quantities. This suggests that storage of labile C reserves in sinks or pools readily accessible to the plant, which allows rapid mobilization after grazing, is an important element of adaptation to grazing. Major storage of labile reserves in stems, characteristic of the NGA plants, may be advantageous in ungrazed habitats where there is vertical growth due to canopy closure and competition for light, but such storage makes those reserves accessible to grazers. GA ecotype plants in the regrowth experiment compensated completely for the eight weekly defoliation events by the time of the 12-wk harvest; yield of the NGA ecotype was reduced 2 1 % by the moderate level of grasshopper grazing. Increased total yield (biomass harvested plus compensation) by the GA ecotype was expressed in both above- and belowground biomass, suggesting that suppression of the latter does not contribute to compensation by the former.","UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT ENTOMOL,ATHENS,GA 30602; DUKE UNIV,DUKE UNIV PHYTOTRON,DURHAM,NC 27706; SRI INT,MENLO PK,CA 94025; UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521; BIOL RES LABS,SYRACUSE,NY 13206","DYER, MI (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,INST ECOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",97,29,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","AUG",1991,72,"4",NA,NA,NA,1472,"1483",NA,"10.2307/1941120",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The mean yearly number of fledglings produced per pair ranged from 0.4 to 3.8 and, for each species, was positively correlated with spring density of Microtus voles. Due to their high degree of mobility, EKs, SOs, and LOs were able to track the population fluctuations of their microtine prey without time lags. An increase in microtine densities caused a rapid immigration into the study area and a decrease caused a rapid emigration from the area. Microtus voles were the most important prey group by mass in the diet of each species. Water voles, bank voles, shrews, and small birds were the most frequent alternate prey. The spring density of Microtus spp. was positively correlated with the percentage of these voles in the diet of EK, SO, and LO. The pooled functional response curve of these three raptor species to the fluctuating densities of Microtus spp. was close to linear, indicating that consumption rates are independent of vole densities.

We addressed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens doralis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans. We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator. Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey: a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles. Two additional ponds received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles. The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus. The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae. At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism. Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren. Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition. Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner. An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage. In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",NA,76,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1991,72,"3",NA,NA,NA,827,"838",NA,"10.2307/1940585",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Removal of single, widely spaced millet seeds provided a reliable measure of bird and rodent foraging activity. Avian foraging activity increased in response to supplemental seeds, but decreased in response to long-term removal of all rodents and all ants. Although birds potentially compete for seeds with rodents and ants, these results suggest that, in the long term, indirect facilitation dominates the interactions among all three taxa. The positive effect of the other granivores on birds may be mediated through changes in habitat structure (e.g., reduction in the density of annual plants). The increase of avian foraging in response to seed addition and the high spatial and temporal variance in the patterns of seed removal by birds indicate that in desert habitats granivorous birds use their mobility to find and exploit high concentrations of seeds. Thus, birds may reduce the spatial variation in seed abundance and reduce the densities of seeds available to other granivores. The foraging behaviour of birds and rodents revealed by these experiments clarifies the response of granivores to experimental manipulations reported earlier, such as the lack of biomass compensation by rodents in response to seed addition.","UNIV IOWA,DEPT BIOL,PROGRAM ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL,IOWA CITY,IA 52242; UNIV NEW MEXICO,DEPT BIOL,ALBUQUERQUE,NM 87131; UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL,TUCSON,AZ 85721",NA,66,30,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1991,72,"3",NA,NA,NA,852,"863",NA,"10.2307/1940587",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Some riparian zones along the Salto are saturated by subsurface inflows of phosphorus-rich, geothermal groundwater of the sodium-chloride-bicarbonate type. The heterogeneous pattern of solute-rich groundwater inflows results in dramatic differences in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration between stream waters of two closely adjacent tributaries. SRP levels also vary dramatically in the water table and in soils across stream riparian zones on a scale of metres. The Salto River (SRP 50-200-mu-g/L) receives steady phosphorus-rich groundwater inflows that become diluted with increasing precipitation. The Pantano lacks these inputs and retains a low background SRP concentration (typically < 10-mu-g/L). SRP levels in waters of the Salto were strongly negatively correlated with discharge (r = - 0.86), while in the Pantano there was no correlation. In situ nutrient bioassays of algal periphyton growth indicated that both nitrate and SRP were at growth-saturating levles in the Salto while, in the Pantano, algal growth was phosphorus limited. The Pantano had a high retention capacity for phosphorus as measured through a whole-stream tracer injection experiment. SRP concentration was reduced by 17 and 94% of injected phosphate over 40 and 800 m reaches, respectively. Results indicate the important linkage between geothermal activity and hydrogeochemical features of the volcanic landscape and their role in regulating ecological processes in these streams.","US GEOL SURVEY,DIV WATER RESOURCES,MENLO PK,CA 94025","PRINGLE, CM (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",63,14,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","JUN",1991,72,"3",NA,NA,NA,951,"965",NA,"10.2307/1940596",15,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Early in the 3rd yr of the study purple clover, Trifolium pratense, a dominant member of the plant community, occurred at higher densities where herbivores were excluded relative to control plots. Following a 1-mo time lag, Trifolium became infected by the rust-forming fungal pathogen Uromyces trifolii; the incidence of infection was higher in exclosures relative to control plots where herbivores were present. Early-to-late season changes in the abundance of Trifolium were related to the degree of fungal infection and not herbivore presence/ absence. Data from the following year (when the fungus and Trifolium were rare) showed clover abundance to be higher in control plots than in exclosures. These results suggest that the negative influence of the fungus not only persisted through time, but more strongly affected host plant abundance in a 2-mo period than did herbivory that occurred in both years. While the direct effect of herbivory on food plants is negative, by keeping plant abundance below that at which fungal infections become epidemic, the net effect of herbivores on some forage plants may be positive. The existence of strong indirect interactions is further evidence that the emphasis in community ecology (and in plant succession) should be on interactive networks rather than on species pairs.","UNIV VIRGINIA, BLANDY EXPTL FARM, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA","BOWERS, MA (corresponding author), UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT ENVIRONM SCI, CLARK HALL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA.",16,17,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","JUN",1991,72,"3",NA,NA,NA,1032,"1037",NA,"10.2307/1940603",6,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The composition of this early hardwood community will be regulated by factors affecting the relative establishment success of these species in old-field habitats. Mechanisms influencing differential seedling emergence of such early successional tree species were studied in multifactor field experiments. Seeds of six wind-dispersed species (Acer rubrum, Fraxinus americana, Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron tulipifera, Ulmus alata, and Pinus taeda) were sown into old fields at equal densities, and their relative germination (emergence) in two successive years was evaluated with respect to: (1) presence of old-field vegetation (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) vertebrate seed predation (tested with exclosures), (3) variation in life history traits (seed size and germination phenology), and (4) variation in physical factors (spring drought). Emergence of one species (Liriodendron) was limited by intrinsically low seed viability. In 1984, a wet spring, emergence of Pinus exceeded that of all hardwood species, and the smaller-seeded Liquidambar and Ulmus had higher emergence than the larger-seeded Acer and Fraxinus. Seed predators reduced emergence proportionately more in larger-seeded species than in smaller-seeded species. Herbaceous cover facilitated emergence of larger-seeded species by providing a moister germination microenvironment, and perhaps also by reducing visibility of seeds to predators. In 1985 an early spring drought reduced emergence of fall-dispersed species (Pinus, Liquidambar, and Fraxinus), whose earlier germination phenology coincided with the drought. Later-germinating, spring-dispersed species (Ulmus and Acer) avoided this drought period and displayed similar germination responses in both years. The prominence of drought effects in 1985 reduced the apparent impact of other experimental factors upon emergence rates.

Mechanisms of trophic bottleneck in lake Valencia were demonstrated through two years of population studies of Xenomelaniris venezuelae, a small planktivorous fish that accounts for most of the zooplankton consumption in open water. Major components of variation in abundance of Xenomelaniris included small-scale spatial (0.1-1.0 km, 70%), large-scale spatial (1-10 km, 23%), and temporal (months, seasons, 7%). The population showed a repeated annual cycle based primarily on a dominant cohort recruited during January and February. Spawning in the littoral zone continued throughout the year, but larvae survived only when rotifer densities exceeded 100 individuals/L, which occurred predictably during late seasonal mixing, but only irregularly thereafter. Steady mortality (15%/mo) of spawning fish occurred through predation. Catastrophic, predictable mortality of all fish occurred through anoxia during early seasonal mixing (57%/mo for two months). Xenomelaniris showed a strong ontogenetic shift in diet from rotifers during early development to copepods and Chaoborus during later development. Daily rations ranged from 28% of dry body mass in the smallest fish to 10% in the largest. Although Xenomelaniris was the only planktivore and was capable of consuming all major zooplankton taxa, it consumed only 3.6% of zooplankton production because it was never sufficiently abundant to exploit its food resource fully. Total growth of adult Xenomelaniris (somatic plus reproductive) conformed to the same equation as somatic growth of juveniles; growth potential was diverted increasingly to reproduction as the fish aged. Young adult fish showed 66% assimilation efficiency and 11% growth efficiency. Respiration losses decreased during development as the 0.73 power of body mass. The annual ratio of production to biomass was high (4.0), reflecting food sufficiency, a long growing season, and continuous loss of older fish to spawning mortality. Annual fresh-mass production of Xenomelaniris (31 kg/ha) is a small proportion of primary production (< 0.03%) and of zooplankton production (3.6%); energy budgets show that actual Xenomelaniris production is only one third of potential production given the observed zooplankton production and the measured growth efficiency of Xenomelaniris. The explanation of this trophic bottleneck is mortality, which prevents the population from reaching carrying capacity and thus blocks energy flow between zooplankton and pelagic fish. Although there were three significant kinds of mortality, larval mortality - apparently through starvation - was the explanation of the trophic bottleneck because it restricted the reproductive output of Xenomelaniris, which could otherwise have brought the population to carrying capacity. The trophic bottleneck may be of significance beyond Lake Valencia, in view of the low diversity and abundance of pelagic planktivores in tropical lakes.","UNIV COLORADO, CTR LIMNOL, DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGANISM BIOL, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA",NA,7,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,440,"456",NA,"10.2307/2937186",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

As an indirect assessment of the likelihood of ecological and evolutionary convergence, I quantified features of community structure and of breeding biology, behavior, and life history of bird species occupying several sites in semi-arid shrub deserts in the Great Basin of North America and the interior of Australia. Study sites on both continents were statistically indistinguishable in most quantitative measures of vegetation structure. Breeding-bird assemblages contained the same number of species per unit area, but densities of individuals in Australia averaged half those in North America. A cluster analysis based on a multivariate similarity matrix derived from 14 ecological and life-history characteristics of the species revealed little close matching of Australian species with a North American counterpart, although two such pairings suggest possible ecological convergence. The frequencies of most ecological/life-history traits among species breeding on local plots differed substantially between continents. The Australian species were characterized by longer breeding periods with more breeding attempts, greater social aggregation during breeding and feeding activities, greater use of domed nests, and sedentariness or nomadism rather than seasonal migration. The avifaunas did not differ in mean clutch sizes, the incidence of polygyny, nesting height, territory size, or general dietary patterns. Despite the close matching of vegetation structure on the two continents, differences between the species and communities are more striking than the similarities. These differences may be related to climatic differences between the areas. Although long-term mean precipitation in the Australian and North American shrub-desert regions does not differ, the monthly and yearly variance in Australia is substantially greater. Droughts may be prolonged and widespread, and this factor, together with soil-nutrient limitations, may result in generally lower and more erratic primary and secondary production in the Australian deserts. Close convergence may be lacking because, despite the similarities in habitat structure, the climates and resource levels of Australian and North American shrub deserts differ in fundamental ways, and the avifaunas are of differing phylogenetic derivation. These comparisons emphasize that (1) bird communities are frequently open, so understanding the composition and dynamics of local assemblages requires a broad-scale perspective, and (2) generalizations or explanations developed for one region of the world may not apply in other regions, even if the habitats are similar.",NA,"WIENS, JA (corresponding author), COLORADO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA.",52,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,479,"495",NA,"10.2307/2937189",17,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Previous inferences about movement among and fidelity to wintering areas have been restricted by limitations of data and methodology. We use multiple observation data from a large-scale capture-resighting study of Canada Geese in the Atlantic flyway to estimate probabilities of returning to previous wintering locations and moving to new locations. Mark-resight data from 28 849 Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) banded with individually coded neck bands in the mid-Atlantic (New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey), Chesapeake (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia), and Carolinas (North and South Carolina) were used to estimate movement and site fidelity. Two three-sample mark-resight models were developed and programmed using SURVIV to estimate the probability of moving among or remaining within these three wintering regions. The model (MV2) that incorporated tradition or memory of previous wintering regions fit the data better than the model (MV1) that assumes that a first-order Markov chain described movement among regions. Considerable levels of movement occurred among regions of the Atlantic flyway. The annual probability of remaining in the same region for two successive winters, used as a measure of site fidelity, was 0.710 +/- 0.016 (estimated mean +/- SE [SE], 0.889 +/- 0.006, and 0.562 +/- 0.025, for the mid-Atlantic, Chesapeake, and Carolinas, respectively. The estimated probability of moving to the Chesapeake from the mid-Atlantic or from the Carolinas was 3 x and 25 x as high, respectively, as the probability of moving in the opposite directions. Changes in estimated probabilities of moving between years corresponded to changes in winter harshness. In warm years, geese moved north and in cold years, they moved south. Geese had a high probability of moving to and remaining in the Chesapeake. Annual changes in the movement probabilities did not correspond to annual changes in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service midwinter survey. Considerable numbers of geese from the Carolinas appeared to be wintering in more northerly locations (short-stopped) in subsequent winters.","CORNELL UNIV, US FISH & WILDLIFE SERV, NEW YORK COOPERAT FISH & WILDLIFE RES UNIT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA","HESTBECK, JB (corresponding author), US FISH & WILDLIFE SERV, PATUXENT WILDLIFE RES CTR, LAUREL, MD 20708 USA.",402,83,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,523,"533",NA,"10.2307/2937193",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Because avian dispersal agents selectively foraged where cone crops were highest, individual trees and stands of trees with greater insect abundances were avoided. Even herbivore-resistant trees with substantial cone crops did not receive dispersal services if they were surrounded by susceptible trees because the birds often ignored entire stands of trees. A cone removal experiment showed that avian seed dispersers also ignored trees with artificially reduced crops even though many cones remained.

I performed a series of field experiments in which I investigated the transmission dynamics of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), in northern Idaho, USA. In these experiments, I reared healthy and infected larvae together on seedling Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and used the number of healthy larvae that became infected as a measure of transmission. I explored the influences of density, stage structure, and spatial structure on transmission by manipulating the density and stage distribution of healthy and infected hosts, and the spatial distribution of infected hosts. The experiments indicate that transmission is strongly affected by the densities of both healthy and infected hosts, but the effect depends on the instar of each. Late instars are both more infectious and more likely to become infected than are early instars, so that the NPV is more likely to spread in populations of late-instar tussock moth larvae. I also found that transmission is affected by the spatial distribution of infected hosts, and this effect also depends on the instar of healthy hosts. That is, transmission to healthy early instars decreases with increasing patchiness of infected hosts, but transmission to healthy late instars is essentially unaffected by patchiness. I discuss how these results can be interpreted in terms of behavioral differences among instars, and relate the results to the mathematical theory of disease and the use of viruses in biological pest control.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195",NA,91,15,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,559,"574",NA,"10.2307/2937196",16,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

In this paper I present a new experimental method for quantifying soil seed bank dynamics in the field and data derived from this method describing the age structure of the seed bank for the winter annual Collinsia verna. The roles of spatial and temporal variation in seed bank formation were investigated using a replicated design arrayed along three transects in the study site. Emergence from and persistence in the seed bank were monitored for 3 yr using experimental seed banks containing seeds of the same age arrayed along each of the three transects. In addition, replicate estimates of survivorship and fecundity of naturally emerging plants were monitored in quadrats arrayed along each of the three transects. The conditional probability of persisting in the seed bank for 1 yr ranged from 14 to 45% and differed significantly among the transects. Significant differences in the probabilities of emerging (or persisting) produced seed banks of varying age structure among the transects and years. A life table analysis of the vegetative plants indicated significant differences between years in their survivorship curves. In addition, seedlings derived from seeds 1 yr old or older germinated significantly later than the general seed population.

The influences of these maternal treatments on the reproduction of progeny were examined in four different progeny environments represented by two treatments: with and without competition, and with and without a nutrient pulse. We found that the effects of maternal nutrient pulses on the two species were related to the environments of both parents and progeny. When grown without competition, progeny from parent P. major plants maintained at the low background nutrient level and given a nutrient pulse had a higher spike biomass and a higher proportional allocation to spikes than did progeny from parents that did not receive a nutrient pulse. In contrast, the progeny of parents that were maintained at the high nutrient level showed no response to a nutrient pulse. In P. rugelii the effect of maternal nutrient pulses on the total and leaf biomass of the progeny was related to both maternal background nutrient levels and nutrient pulse treatments to the progeny. For both species, the timing of maternal nutrient pulses had no significant effect on the characters studied. In competition, for P. major, the progeny from parents given a nutrient pulse during fruit maturation consistently produced a greater amount of spike biomass relative to their neighboring plants from parents that did not receive nutrient pulses, regardless of both the maternal background nutrients and progeny pulse treatments. However, for the progeny from parents given a nutrient pulse during the vegetative and flowering stages, their competitive ability relative to their neighbors depended on both the timing of maternal pulse and the progeny pulse treatment. For P. rugelii, the performance (leaf biomass) of the two neighboring progeny depended on maternal background nutrient levels. These results show that maternal nutrient conditions can influence competitive interactions in the progeny generation. The effects may have ecological and evolutionary implications particularly for initial colonization of infertile sites and for the ability of natural selection to act on phenotypic variation. The strength of these maternal effects depends on both the maternal environment and the progeny environment.","BOSTON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BOSTON,MA 02215","MIAO, SL (corresponding author), HARVARD UNIV,DEPT ORGANISM & EVOLUT BIOL,BIOL LAB,16 DIVIN AVE,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138, USA.",52,10,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,586,"596",NA,"10.2307/2937198",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Data on gender and flowering frequency were collected for 2 yr from 186 orchids occurring in both young (70-100 yr old) and mature forests. The distribution of phenotypic gender ratio was strongly bimodal in the population, and sex ratios were significantly affected by forest age. In the young forest the sex ratio was significantly female biased, while the sex ratio in the mature forest was statistically indistinguishable from 1:1. Gender in C. viridiflavum is largely determined by light intensity. Females occurred most frequently in open canopies, and males predominated in closed canopies. Experimental shading of developing inflorescences of well-illuminated plants duplicated this pattern, suggesting sex expression is controlled by cues received by the developing inflorescence. Small, but significant effects of plant size on gender were also detected. Forty-two percent of plants occurred on dead, decaying wood (mostly standing dead trees), while the remainder occurred on live trees. Substrate type and canopy openness are correlated because dead trees present no canopy to shade epiphytes on them. Differences in sex ratio due to forest type resulted from a more frequent occurrence of plants on standing dead trees in the young vs. the mature forest. Theory for the evolution of environmental sex determination (ESD) assumes that environment affects reproductive success (RS), but that the relationship between RS and environment is different for males and females. Light availability and substrate were investigated for their effects on two components of RS, flowering frequency and vegetative growth. C. viridiflavum on dead, decaying wood flowered more often than those on live trees, but no significant effect due to canopy openness was detected. The influence of substrate and light availability on estimated rates of vegetative growth varied from year to year, but increased rates were associated with either dead, decaying wood or high light intensities in at least 1 yr. Thus, explanations for the evolution of ESD in C. viridiflavum must include potential effects of both substrate type and light environment on male and female RS. Plants growing on dead, decaying wood in an open habitat that produced fruit exhibited reduced vegetative growth compared to nonfruiting plants, indicating there is long-term cost to fruit production in C. viridiflavum. In forest habitats, females setting fruit on live trees did not flower in the following year. Most nonfruiting females on this substrate type, as well as fruiting and nonfruiting plants on dead trees, flowered in the following year. Although samples sizes supporting this pattern were small, it is consistent with the hypothesis that sex differences in costs of reproduction in response to changes in substrate (and correlated changes in light availability) may explain the evolution of ESD in C. viridiflavum.",NA,"ZIMMERMAN, JK (corresponding author), SMITHSONIAN ENVIRONM RES CTR, POB 28, EDGEWATER, MD 21037 USA.",62,18,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,597,"608",NA,"10.2307/2937200",12,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The tree population density before and almost-equal-to 30 yr after fire was estimated by censusing trees in plots of 400 m2 located in upland and lowland within four representative ecoregions of northern Quebec. The analysis of tree recruitment before and after fire, in 410 randomly selected sites along a transect crossing the upper boreal forest and forest-tundra zones, indicated that wildfires induced substantial depletion of tree populations. Taken as a whole, fires have significantly reduced the density of black spruce populations in forest-tundra uplands, but not in the lowlands. A reduction in tree population density of greater-than-or-equal-to 75% was observed in 22% of upper boreal forest sites, and 45% and 93% of sites located in the forest and shrub subzones, respectively, of the forest-tundra zone. Complete exclusion of tree populations by fire was observed in 43% of upland sites in the northern part of the transect, while complete removal was a rare event in the southern part. Sustained reduction of tree population density after several destructive fires appears as one of the main deforestation processes in the subarctic zone. This leads to the patchy distribution of forest stands and scattered tree populations typical of the forest-tundra biome. Comparisons with paleoecological data suggest that the impact of the 1950s fires contributed to the expansion of the forest tundra into the upper boreal forest. The ecological impact of these fires was probably similar to those fires responsible for development of the forest tundra during the Holocene. It is suggested that the fire-climate interaction should be considered in order to predict the ecological impact of warming climate on high-latitude forest ecosystems.","UNIV LAVAL,CTR ETUD NORD,QUEBEC CITY G1K 7P4,QUEBEC,CANADA",NA,76,25,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,619,"627",NA,"10.2307/2937202",9,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The effects of classification error on transition rate estimates were modeled and error adjustments made. Classification of the 1973 and 1983 Landsat images of the 900 km2 study region required a relatively small set of ground-observed and photo-interpreted plots in 1983, with a total area of just 1.62 km2. An innovative technique for correcting multiyear Landsat images for between-image differences in atmospheric effects and sensor calibration, permitted classification of the 1973 Landsat image using 1983 ground observations. Given current Landsat data, and ground observations in one year, this technique would permit monitoring of forest succession and dynamics for nearly a 20-yr period. Results of applying these techniques to a forest ecosystem showed that during the 10-yr observation period it was patchy and dynamic. For both a wilderness and a nonwilderness area in the study region, sizeable values of transition rates were observed and over half of the landscape units were observed to change state; however, a Markov analysis, using the observed transition probabilities, suggests that at the regional level neither the wilderness nor the nonwilderness areal proportions of ecological states are undergoing rapid change.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106; UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,ENVIRONM STUDIES PROGRAM,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106; VERSAR,COLUMBIA,MD 20771; BENNINGTON COLL,DIV SCI,BENNINGTON,VT 05201; SCI APPLICAT RES,LANHAM,MD 20771","HALL, FG (corresponding author), NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,CODE 923,GREENBELT,MD 20771, USA.",213,61,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,628,"&",NA,"10.2307/2937203",0,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Brown's niche-based model, Levins' stochastic immigration-extinction model, and Hanski's core-satellite hypothesis (a modification of Levins' model) differ in relative spatial scales, and degree of stochastic variation in species distribution over time. To test the predictions of these models, we analyzed the regional distribution and temporal dynamics of plant species across 19 sites in tallgrass prairie over an 8-yr period. Spatial patterns of species regional distribution were bimodal each year, a pattern in accord with the core-satellite hypothesis. In addition, temporal patterns of species distribution within a site were also bimodal. The dynamics of the core-satellite hypothesis are driven by patterns of immigration and extinction. Extinction was positively related to richness, however, in contrast to the theory of island biogeography, immigration was not related to species richness. In addition, the variances in the differences in species frequencies from one year to the next were greater than three times the mean, a condition necessary for bimodality in the core-satellite model, for 88 of 135 (65.1%) species. These results provide strong support in favor of the core-satellite hypothesis and imply that stochastic factors may be the primary determinant of plant species dynamics and plant community structure in grasslands at the scale of several kilometres.

N content and allocation are canopy properties that link ecosystem, physiological, and biophysical processes and that vary in space at scales relevant to atmosphere-biosphere interaction. We studied landscape-scale variation in these and related canopy properties in Kansas Tallgrass Prairie (USA). The tallgrass ecosystem was suited to this investigation because primary production in the prairie is constrained by N availability. This work was designed to aid in interpretation and spatial extrapolation of gas exchange measurements made using aerodynamic techniques as part of FIFE (First ISLSCP Field Experiment), a NASA-supported study. We collected data on spatial distribution of biomass, leaf area index (LAI), canopy N mass, N concentration ([N]), and gas exchange along topographic and management gradients. We also measured height distribution of N, light interception, and gas exchange within canopies as a function of position in the landscape. Substantial variation in biomass, LAI, N accumulation, and N allocation occurred over time, with topography, and as a result of previous burning. The vertical gradient of [N] and photosynthetic capacity within canopies were correlated, in space and time, with biomass and canopy light interception. The gradients were steeper in high biomass sites than in low biomass sites. In addition, proportional N allocation to the upper layer increased with time (12% in June, 32% in August) as biomass increased. As nutrient uptake increased within the tallgrass landscape, biomass increased and light limitation in the lower canopy was induced. As this light limitation increased with increasing biomass, or with accumulation of dead vegetation, allocation of N to the upper canopy increased. Height distribution of photosynthetic capacity paralleled within-canopy N allocation and light interception. As resource ratios (light, water, and nitrogen) varied in the landscape, so did rates of gas exchange. This work suggests that interactions between light extinction, N allocation, and photosynthesis that have been proposed for monospecific stands apply to the multispecies, but structurally simple, canopy of the tallgrass prairie. Models of plant performance based on evolutionary arguments may provide a powerful basis for spatial extrapolation of atmosphere-ecosystem exchange rates from sites to landscapes and larger regions.","COLORADO STATE UNIV,COOPERAT INST RES ATMOSPHERE,FT COLLINS,CO 80523; KANSAS STATE UNIV AGR & APPL SCI,DIV BIOL,MANHATTAN,KS 66506","SCHIMEL, DS (corresponding author), COLORADO STATE UNIV,NAT RESOURCE ECOL LAB,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",147,39,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","APR",1991,72,"2",NA,NA,NA,672,"684",NA,"10.2307/2937207",13,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Mapping of gopher mound formation indicated that the probability that gophers would disturb any given area during the 6-yr study period had a near normal distribution with a peak at two disturbances during that period. Disturbance levels varied considerably from year to year and spatially, and thus the disturbance regime is complex. Exclosure experiments indicated that gopher disturbance had a significant effect on the abundances of many of the grassland annuals, perennial grasses, and cormaceous species. Aboveground herbivores had no detectable effects. Over the period of the study annual rainfall varied threehold and plant community dynamics were strongly affected by this. In particular, Plantago erecta decreased and Lasthenia californica increased in abundance with increasing rainfall. Abnormally high rainfall in 1982-1984 allowed the buildup of populations of Bromus mollis, the only nonnative species that invades the serpentine significantly. B. mollis was, however, subsequently virtually eliminated from the serpentine grassland by two consecutive years of severe drought. Invasion of B. mollis was found only on gopher mounds formed in 1983. In subsequent years recolonization of gopher mounds was predominantly by other species, in particular Lotus subpinnatus. Interannual variability in species abundances was most apparent on disturbed microsites.

Spartina patens and Juncus gerardi dominate the seaward and terrestrial borders of the high marsh, respectively, whereas Distichlis spicata is common in disturbed habitats. In this paper I examine the role of interspecific interactions among these marsh perennials in maintaining marsh plant zonation. Removal and transplant experiments were performed to examine species interactions in dense stands. In both types of experiments J. gerardi competitively dominated S. patens and D. spicata, while S. patens competitively dominated D. spicata. Each of these perennials showed maximum growth when transplanted into the J. gerardi zone without neighbors. J. gerardi appears to dominate the terrestrial border of the marsh by competitively excluding S. patens to lower marsh levels, while D. spicata is competitively restricted to disturbed habitats by both J. gerardi and S. patens. Species interactions during the colonization of bare patches were strikingly different than those found in dense vegetation. Colonization of bare patches by both S. patens and D. spicata facilitated the colonization of J. gerardi, the competitive dominant in dense vegetation. Bare patches in the high marsh are typically hypersaline due to increased surface evaporation in the absence of plant cover. Patch colonization by competitive subordinates, which are relatively salt tolerant, appears to reduce substrate salinity by passively shading the substrate and, as a by-product, facilitate the invasion of a superior competitor. While interspecific competition in dense vegetation dictates the zonation of New England perennials in the high marsh, secondary succession in this assemblage may commonly be driven by facilitations.

Spartina alterniflora monocultures dominate low marsh habitats while the seaward border of high marsh habitats is generally dominated by Spartina patens. In this paper I examine the role of interspecific competition in maintaining this zonation pattern. Spartina patens turfs and tillers transplanted into the low marsh were severely stunted with or without S. alterniflora neighbors, and low marsh bare patches bordering S. patens monocultures were not significantly colonized by S. patens in three growing seasons. The limited ability of S. patens to oxygenate its rhizosphere in anoxic soils appears to limit S. patens to high marsh habitats. In contrast, S. alterniflora transplants grew vigorously in the high and low marsh when buffered from neighbors, but were excluded from the high marsh in 2-3 yr when S. patens was present. S. alterniflora also rapidly invaded the high marsh in the absence of S. patens. These results support the hypothesis that S. alterniflora is restricted to low marsh habitats by competitive displacement. S. alterniflora thrives in anoxic low marsh habitats due to its ability to oxygenate its roots and rhizosphere. Rhizosphere oxidation by S. alterniflora, however, is not evident in seedlings and small colonizing patches and both seedlings and small colonizing patches of S. alterniflora are stunted in anoxic low marsh substrates. This suggests that the success of S. alterniflora in anoxic habitats is size dependent and may be driven by group benefits of rhizosphere oxidation. These results suggest that the maintenance of intertidal zonation in rocky beach and marsh plant communities is very similar. In both assemblages, competitive dominants monopolize physically benign habitats and displace competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats.",NA,"BERTNESS, MD (corresponding author), BROWN UNIV,GRAD PROGRAM ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL,PROVIDENCE,RI 02912, USA.",349,157,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1991,72,"1",NA,NA,NA,138,"148",NA,"10.2307/1938909",11,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

The method of reconstructing the fire frequency was to build a stand-origin map, from this estimate the mixed time-since-fire distribution, and then use a graphic technique to partition the mixed distribution into two homogeneous fire-frequency distributions. The fire frequency for the last 380 yr in the 495-km2 Kananaskis Watershed showed a temporal change in fire frequency at almost-equal-to 1730. This change in fire frequency is related to a change from a warmer and drier climate before 1730 to a cooler and moister climate since then. When the fire-frequency data were partitioned by a graphic technique, the two resulting fire frequencies fit negative exponential distributions. For the period 1730-1980 the fire cycle (the time required to burn an area equal to the area of study, or one divided by the scale parameter of the exponential distribution) was 90 yr. For the period before 1730 the fire cycle was 50 yr. The Watershed could not be subdivided into smaller, spatially homogeneous fire-frequency units. The negative exponential distribution of fire frequencies suggests a constant hazard function (mortality force). This constant hazard was corroborated by a spatial correlation (Moran's I) test which found no spatial pattern other than ones expected by chance between forest ages on either side of all fire boundaries. Thus, there was no tendency for young stands to be associated either with only younger- or only older-aged stands. Other studies on fire behavior in the Watershed corroborate the short fire cycle, constant hazard, and lack of spatial fire-frequency differences, and suggest that the regional climate control of the temporal fire frequency is related to a characteristic synoptic weather pattern and the resulting high intensity and high rate-of-spread of fires.","UNIV CALGARY,KANANASKIS CTR ENVIRONM RES,CALGARY T2N 1N4,ALBERTA,CANADA","JOHNSON, EA (corresponding author), UNIV CALGARY,DEPT BIOL SCI,DIV ECOL,CALGARY T2N 1N4,ALBERTA,CANADA.",154,27,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1991,72,"1",NA,NA,NA,194,"201",NA,"10.2307/1938914",8,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

We examined diet choice in a generalist carnivore, the Herring Gull, Larus argentatus, in relation to both nesting habitat and reproductive performance over a 2-yr period. During prelaying and incubation periods 75-80% of Herring Gulls specialized on either intertidal organisms, human refuse, or other seabirds, while only 20-25% had generalized diets. Specific types of specialists tended to nest in particular habitats. Foraging tactics associated with each of the three diets were related to time budgets and ecological constraints, i.e., levels of predation or intraspecific competition in specific habitats. Variation in diet choice was also strongly related to individual breeding performance. Intertidal specialists laid eggs earlier, produced larger and heavier clutches, and had higher rates of hatching than generalists and other specialists. This pattern held true over both years of the study even though weather conditions, and food accessibility, differed between years. Despite differences in performance related to laying and hatching, there were no significant differences in fledging rates, either between years or among diets. These results suggest that (a) choice of nesting habitat may constrain diet choice, (b) diet choice may have major effects on breeding performance, and (c) energy may not be the proper currency for examining diet choice in carnivores subject to a variety of constraints.","UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA","PIEROTTI, R (corresponding author), UNIV ARKANSAS, DEPT ZOOL, US FISH & WILDLIFE SERV, ARKANSAS COOPERAT RES UNIT, FAYETTEVILLE, AR 72701 USA.",157,64,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","FEB",1991,72,"1",NA,NA,NA,319,"328",NA,"10.2307/1938925",10,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"

Eight published time series of species abundances were used in the analysis, including data sets for: fishes, birds, mammals, stream benthos, and crabs. To test the efficacy of eigenvalue tests, we constructed 1000 randomly generated data sets for each real data set, whose means and variances were identical to the means and variances of the original data matrices. The data sets were then subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue tests used to identify significant eigenvalues for both correlation and covariance matrix solutions. We also examined the effects of: (1) number of species (= number of variables), (2) number of samples (= replication), and (3) variance structure, on the performance of the test. Using PCA's based on the correlation matrix and with sample sizes typically encountered in the field, the eigenvalue tests generally performed at the .05 level when alpha = .01. Slightly poorer results were obtained with the covariance matrix. Increasing the number of samples to at least three times the number of species generally gave alpha level coverage for an alpha level test (i.e., alpha = .05, .01). Increasing variance in the data set only affected test outcomes at levels of replication less than twice the number of species. We conclude that the eigenvalue tests can be used to detect patterns in PCA's of assemblage structure data, if the number of samples is at least three times the number of species and either a covariance or correlation matrix solution is used. It is assumed that these patterns represent ecologically meaningful patterns of variation.","UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT STAT,ATHENS,GA 30602","GROSSMAN, GD (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,SCH FOREST RESOURCES,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",69,15,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","FEB",1991,72,"1",NA,NA,NA,341,"347",NA,"10.2307/1938927",7,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology",NA,"2021-05-12"
